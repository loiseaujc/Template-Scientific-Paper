  abstract = {This study introduces a sparse identification-based model predictive control (MPC) framework that incorporates on-line updates of the sparse-identified model to account for nonlinear dynamics and model uncertainty in process systems. The methodology involves obtaining a nonlinear first-order ordinary differential equation model using sparse identification for nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which is integrated into two control schemes: Lyapunov-based MPC (LMPC) for achieving steady-state operation and Lyapunov-based economic MPC (LEMPC) for achieving both closed-loop stability and optimal economic performance. To improve prediction accuracy, an on-line model update scheme is proposed for the SINDy models. Specifically, an error-trigger mechanism that utilizes prediction errors and then uses the most recent process data to update the parameters of the SINDy model in real-time is designed. By incorporating the error-triggered on-line model updates in the SINDy-based LMPC and LEMPC, the dynamic performance of the process is enhanced, ensuring closed-loop stability, optimality, and smooth control actions. Following theoretical results on the boundedness of the closed-loop states and detailed discussions on the selection criteria for parameters of the error-triggered SINDy update scheme, the effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through a chemical process example with time-varying disturbances under the LEMPC framework.},

  abstract = {The Scheduled Relaxation Jacobi (SRJ) method is an extension of the classical Jacobi iterative method to solve linear systems of equations (Au=b) associated with elliptic problems. It inherits its robustness and accelerates its convergence rate computing a set of P relaxation factors that result from a minimization problem. In a typical SRJ scheme, the former set of factors is employed in cycles of M consecutive iterations until a prescribed tolerance is reached. We present the analytic form for the optimal set of relaxation factors for the case in which all of them are strictly different, and find that the resulting algorithm is equivalent to a non-stationary generalized Richardson's method where the matrix of the system of equations is preconditioned multiplying it by D=diag(A). Our method to estimate the weights has the advantage that the explicit computation of the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of the matrix A (or the corresponding iteration matrix of the underlying weighted Jacobi scheme) is replaced by the (much easier) calculation of the maximum and minimum frequencies derived from a von Neumann analysis of the continuous elliptic operator. This set of weights is also the optimal one for the general problem, resulting in the fastest convergence of all possible SRJ schemes for a given grid structure. The amplification factor of the method can be found analytically and allows for the exact estimation of the number of iterations needed to achieve a desired tolerance. We also show that with the set of weights computed for the optimal SRJ scheme for a fixed cycle size it is possible to estimate numerically the optimal value of the parameter {$\omega$} in the Successive Overrelaxation (SOR) method in some cases. Finally, we demonstrate with practical examples that our method also works very well for Poisson-like problems in which a high-order discretization of the Laplacian operator is employed (e.g., a 9- or 17-points discretization). This is of interest since the former discretizations do not yield consistently ordered A matrices and, hence, the theory of Young cannot be used to predict the optimal value of the SOR parameter. Furthermore, the optimal SRJ schemes deduced here are advantageous over existing SOR implementations for high-order discretizations of the Laplacian operator in as much as they do not need to resort to multi-coloring schemes for their parallel implementation.},

  abstract = {Elliptic partial differential equations (ePDEs) appear in a wide variety of areas of mathematics, physics and engineering. Typically, ePDEs must be solved numerically, which sets an ever growing demand for efficient and highly parallel algorithms to tackle their computational solution. The Scheduled Relaxation Jacobi (SRJ) is a promising class of methods, atypical for combining simplicity and efficiency, that has been recently introduced for solving linear Poisson-like ePDEs. The SRJ methodology relies on computing the appropriate parameters of a multilevel approach with the goal of minimizing the number of iterations needed to cut down the residuals below specified tolerances. The efficiency in the reduction of the residual increases with the number of levels employed in the algorithm. Applying the original methodology to compute the algorithm parameters with more than 5 levels notably hinders obtaining optimal SRJ schemes, as the mixed (non-linear) algebraic-differential system of equations from which they result becomes notably stiff. Here we present a new methodology for obtaining the parameters of SRJ schemes that overcomes the limitations of the original algorithm and provide parameters for SRJ schemes with up to 15 levels and resolutions of up to 215 points per dimension, allowing for acceleration factors larger than several hundreds with respect to the Jacobi method for typical resolutions and, in some high resolution cases, close to 1000. Most of the success in finding SRJ optimal schemes with more than 10 levels is based on an analytic reduction of the complexity of the previously mentioned system of equations. Furthermore, we extend the original algorithm to apply it to certain systems of non-linear ePDEs.},

We put forth a framework to apply a continuous time control signal in the latent space of the reduced order model (ROM) to account for the effect of truncation. We set the control input using parameterized models by following energy transfer principles. Our methodology relies on observing the system behavior in the physical space and using the projection operator to restrict the feedback signal into the latent space. Then, we leverage the forward sensitivity method (FSM) to derive relationships between the feedback and the desired mode-dependent control. We test the performance of the proposed approach using two test cases, corresponding to viscous Burgers and vortex merger problems at high Reynolds number. Results show that the ROM trajectory with the applied FSM control closely matches its target values in both the data-dense and data-sparse regimes.},

The membrane of the cell and of its nucleus are modelled as a thin elastic material obeying a Neo-Hookean constitutive law. The fluid{\textendash}structure coupling is obtained using an immersed boundary method. The variations induced by the presence of the nucleus on the cell deformation are investigated when varying the viscosity ratio between the inner and outer fluids, the membrane elasticity and its bending stiffness. The deformation of the eukaryotic cell is smaller than that of the prokaryotic one. The reduction in deformation increases for larger values of the capillary number. The eukaryotic cell remains thicker in its middle part compared to the prokaryotic one, thus making it less flexible to pass through narrow capillaries. For a viscosity ratio of 5, the deformation of the cell is smaller than in the case of uniform viscosity. In addition, for non-zero bending stiffness of the membrane, the deformation decreases and the shape is closer to an ellipsoid. Finally, we compare the results obtained modelling the nucleus as an inner stiffer membrane with those obtained using a rigid particle.},

With this consideration, associated mechanisms as well as active regions are identified, which further confirm that the sensitivity area of the corner mode arises along the intersection of flat plates. Then, an optimization technique shows that a small deviation of the reference field in the area of uncertainty observed in experiments leads to decrease critical Reynolds number.

Fluids 4, 093901 (2019)] to the laminar adiabatic supersonic case. Spatially distributed in the wall-normal direction, a {$\delta$}-correlated Gaussian noise is considered as input, both including the velocity and temperature fields. Similarly, components of the resulting velocity and/or temperature fields are chosen as outputs. To study effects on the boundary layer, the measurements of the output are restricted within the {$\delta$}99 boundary layer thickness, implying, however, that effects like acoustic radiation to the free stream are outside the scope of the present analysis. The main goal of the study is twofold: first, to demonstrate the potential of the chosen approach by comparison with familiar results, and second, to extend the current state of knowledge in the compressible regime in selected points by exploiting the extended capabilities of the chosen framework. To this end, the importance of the different inputs{\textemdash}especially the temperature effects{\textemdash}for the amplification of two-dimensional, oblique flow structures and streaks are discussed. Furthermore, the influence of first and second Mach modes (not present in the incompressible regime) is identified within the stochastic framework and results are discussed in light of previous receptivity analyses where the output is restricted to a single mode. By varying the spatial distribution of the forcing, the dependence of the receptivity on the wall-normal position, where the forcing is introduced, is illustrated and discussed. Finally, dominant coherent structures are identified by evaluating the first singular vector of the correlation matrix (proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) modes). By analyzing the dependence of both forcing and response POD modes on the choice of the measured component, further insight is provided about the contribution of temperature fluctuation to the stochastically maintained variance of the system.},

Using this strategy, we are able to learn the cost and dynamics of a controller via end-to-end learning. Our experiments focus on imitation learning in the pendulum and cartpole domains, where we learn the cost and dynamics terms of an MPC policy class.

This includes the classical measure-preserving systems, as well as systems whose attractors support a physical measure. Our approach relies on the observation that vector projections in DMD can be used to approximate the function projections by the virtue of Birkhoff's ergodic theorem. Using this fact, we show that applying DMD to Hankel data matrices in the limit of infinite-time observations yields the true Koopman eigenfunctions and eigenvalues. We also show that the singular value decomposition, which is the central part of most DMD algorithms, converges to the proper orthogonal decomposition of observables. We use this result to obtain a representation of the dynamics of systems with continuous spectrum based on the lifting of the coordinates to the space of observables. The numerical application of these methods is demonstrated using well-known dynamical systems and examples from computational fluid dynamics.},

We adapt two algorithms, from the classical Fourier and power spectral analysis, to compute the discrete and continuous spectrum of the Koopman operator for the post-transient flows. Properties of the Koopman operator spectrum are linked to the sequence of flow regimes occurring between \$Re=10000\$ and \$Re=30000\$, and changing the flow nature from steady to aperiodic. The Koopman eigenfunctions for different flow regimes, including flows with mixed spectra, are constructed using the assumption of ergodicity in the state space. The associated Koopman modes show remarkable robustness even as the temporal nature of the flow is changing substantially.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a QNN trained through convex optimization is employed as the Q-function approximator (QFA). The main advantage is that the QNN's input-output mapping has an analytical expression as a quadratic form, which can then be used to obtain an analytical expression for policy improvement. This is in stark contrast to the available techniques in the literature that must train a second neural network to obtain policy improvement. The article establishes the convergence of the learning algorithm to the optimal control, provided the system is controllable and one starts from a stabilitzing policy.

In developing these applications, multiple authors have observed that delay embedding appears to separate the data into modes, whose orientations depend only on the spectrum of the sampled system. In this work, we make this observation precise by proving that the eigenvectors of the delay-embedded linearized system at a fixed point are determined solely by the corresponding eigenvalues, even for multi-dimensional observables. This implies that the tangent space of a delay-embedded invariant manifold can be predicted a priori using an estimate of the eigenvalues. We apply our results to three datasets to identify multimodal SSMs and analyse their nonlinear modal interactions. While SSMs are the focus of our study, these results generalize to any delay-embedded invariant manifold tangent to a set of eigenvectors at a fixed point.

Even though this can be recast into an ordinary differential equation (ODE), where standard solvers can be applied, the dominating approach in Kalman filter applications is to discretize the system and then apply the discrete-time difference Lyapunov equation (DDLE). To avoid problems with stability and poor accuracy, oversampling is often used. This contribution analyzes over-sampling strategies, and proposes a novel lowcomplexity analytical solution that does not involve oversampling. The results are illustrated on Kalman filtering problems in both linear and nonlinear systems.},

  abstract = {We propose a new method for computing Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) evolution matrices, which we use to analyze dynamical systems. Unlike the majority of existing methods, our approach is based on a variational formulation consisting of data alignment penalty terms and constitutive orthogonality constraints. Our method does not make any assumptions on the structure of the data or their size, and thus it is applicable to a wide range of problems including non-linear scenarios or extremely small observation sets. In addition, our technique is robust to noise that is independent of the dynamics and it does not require input data to be sequential. Our key idea is to introduce a regularization term for the forward and backward dynamics. The obtained minimization problem is solved efficiently using the Alternating Method of Multipliers (ADMM) which requires two Sylvester equation solves per iteration. Our numerical scheme converges empirically and is similar to a provably convergent ADMM scheme. We compare our approach to various state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark dynamical systems.},

In this monograph, we present the theory of submodular functions from a convex analysis perspective, presenting tight links between certain polyhedra, combinatorial optimization and convex optimization problems. In particular, we show how submodular function minimization is equivalent to solving a wide variety of convex optimization problems. This allows the derivation of new efficient algorithms for approximate and exact submodular function minimization with theoretical guarantees and good practical performance. By listing many examples of submodular functions, we review various applications to machine learning, such as clustering, experimental design, sensor placement, graphical model structure learning or subset selection, as well as a family of structured sparsity-inducing norms that can be derived and used from submodular functions.},

  abstract = {Research in modern data-driven dynamical systems is typically focused on the three key challenges of high dimensionality, unknown dynamics and nonlinearity. The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has emerged as a cornerstone for modelling high-dimensional systems from data. However, the quality of the linear DMD model is known to be fragile with respect to strong nonlinearity, which contaminates the model estimate. By contrast, sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics learns fully nonlinear models, disambiguating the linear and nonlinear effects, but is restricted to low-dimensional systems. In this work, we present a kernel method that learns interpretable data-driven models for high-dimensional, nonlinear systems. Our method performs kernel regression on a sparse dictionary of samples that appreciably contribute to the dynamics. We show that this kernel method efficiently handles high-dimensional data and is flexible enough to incorporate partial knowledge of system physics. It is possible to recover the linear model contribution with this approach, thus separating the effects of the implicitly defined nonlinear terms. We demonstrate our approach on data from a range of nonlinear ordinary and partial differential equations. This framework can be used for many practical engineering tasks such as model order reduction, diagnostics, prediction, control and discovery of governing laws.},

DMD is a widely-used data analysis technique that extracts low-rank modal structures and dynamics from high-dimensional measurements. However, DMD frequently produces models that are sensitive to noise, fail to generalize outside the training data, and violate basic physical laws. Our physics-informed DMD (piDMD) optimization, which may be formulated as a Procrustes problem, restricts the family of admissible models to a matrix manifold that respects the physical structure of the system. We focus on five fundamental physical principles {\textendash} conservation, self-adjointness, localization, causality, and shift-invariance {\textendash} and derive several closed-form solutions and efficient algorithms for the corresponding piDMD optimizations. With fewer degrees of freedom, piDMD models are less prone to overfitting, require less training data, and are often less computationally expensive to build than standard DMD models. We demonstrate piDMD on a range of challenging problems in the physical sciences, including energypreserving fluid flow, travelling-wave systems, the Schro{\textasciidieresis} dinger equation, solute advectiondiffusion, a system with causal dynamics, and three-dimensional transitional channel flow. In each case, piDMD significantly outperforms standard DMD in metrics such as spectral identification, state prediction, and estimation of optimal forcings and responses.},

Input-output analysis generalizes hydrodynamic stability analysis by considering a finite-time horizon over which energy amplification, driven by a specific input (disturbances/actuator) and measured at a specific output (sensor), is observed. In the control design the loop is closed between the output and the input through a feedback gain. Model reduction approximates the system with a low-order model, making modern control design computationally tractable for systems of large dimensions.

We propose an automated approach using the symmetric and self-similar structure of available measurement data to discover the dimensionless groups that best collapse these data to a lower dimensional space according to an optimal fit. We develop three data-driven techniques that use the Buckingham Pi theorem as a constraint: (1) a constrained optimization problem with a non-parametric input{\textendash}output fitting function, (2) a deep learning algorithm (BuckiNet) that projects the input parameter space to a lower dimension in the first layer and (3) a technique based on sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics to discover dimensionless equations whose coefficients parameterize the dynamics. We explore the accuracy, robustness and computational complexity of these methods and show that they successfully identify dimensionless groups in three example problems: a bead on a rotating hoop, a laminar boundary layer and Rayleigh{\textendash}B{\'e}nard convection.},

In case of supervised dimensionality reduction, for any input vector the target value is known, which can be a class label also. In a supervised approach, our objective is to select a subset of features that has adequate discriminating power to predict the target value. This target value for an input vector is absent in case of an unsupervised approach. In an unsupervised scheme, we mainly try to find a subset that can capture the inherent ``structure'' of the data, such as the neighborhood relation or the cluster structure. In this work, we first study a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based unsupervised feature selection approach proposed by Varshavsky et al. Then we propose a modification of this method to improve its performance. An SVD-entropy based supervised feature selection algorithm is also developed in this paper. Performance evaluation of the algorithms is done on altogether 13 benchmark and one Synthetic data sets. The quality of the selected features is assessed using three indices: Sammon's Error (SE), Cluster Preservation Index (CPI) and MisClassification Error (MCE) using a 1-Nearest Neighbor (1-NN) classifier. Besides showing the improvement of the modified unsupervised scheme over the existing one, we have also made a comparative study of the modified unsupervised and the proposed supervised algorithms with one well-known unsupervised and two popular supervised feature selection methods respectively. Our results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in selecting relevant features.},

This reduces by half the number of required measurements, compared to the standard (deterministic) setup. We prove the conjecture for ergodic measures and show that it holds for a generic smooth diffeomorphism, if the information dimension is replaced by the Hausdorff one. To this aim, we prove a general version of predictable embedding theorem for injective Lipschitz maps on compact sets and arbitrary Borel probability measures. We also construct an example of a \$C\^{\textbackslash}infty\$-smooth diffeomorphism with a natural measure, for which the conjecture does not hold in its original formulation.},

At sufficient mass loadings, interphase momentum exchange between the phases results in the spontaneous generation of particle clusters that sustain velocity fluctuations in the fluid. Data generated from Eulerian{\textendash}Lagrangian simulations are used in a sparse regression method for model closure that ensures form invariance. Particular attention is paid to modelling the unclosed terms unique to the multiphase RANS equations (drag production, drag exchange, pressure strain and viscous dissipation). A minimal set of tensors is presented that serve as the basis for modelling. It is found that sparse regression identifies compact, algebraic models that are accurate across flow conditions and robust to sparse training data.},

This bridges the associated research tracks and allows for an easy transition between these two approaches. Original contributions include a modified algorithm for computing the Riemannian logarithm map on the Grassmannian that is advantageous numerically but also allows for a more elementary, yet more complete description of the cut locus and the conjugate points.

Two successive bifurcations lead to two limit cycles with different frequencies and different numbers of structures which propagate along the top of the cavity and circulate in its interior. A branch of quasi-periodic states produced by secondary Hopf bifurcations transfers the stability from one limit cycle to the other. A full analysis of this scenario is obtained by means of nonlinear simulations, linear stability analysis and Floquet analysis. We characterize the temporal behaviour of the limit cycles and quasi-periodic state via Fourier transforms and their spatial behaviour via the Hilbert transform. We address the relevance of linearization about the mean flow. Although here the nonlinear frequencies are not very far from those obtained by linearization about the base flow, the difference is substantially reduced when eigenvalues are obtained instead from linearization about the mean and in addition, the corresponding growth rate is small, a combination of properties called RZIF (real zero imaginary frequency). Moreover growth rates obtained by linearization about the mean of one limit cycle are correlated with relative stability to the other limit cycle. Finally, we show that the frequencies of the successive modes are separated by a constant increment.},

At the same time, this healthy competition is only beneficial if the research output is actually comparable to prior results. Fairly comparing algorithms can be a complex endeavor, as the implementation, configuration, compute environment, and test problems need to be well-defined. Due to the increase in computer-based experiments, new infrastructure for facilitating the exchange and comparison of new algorithms is also needed. To this end, we propose a benchmark framework, as a set of generic specifications for comparing implementations of algorithms using test cases native to a community. Its value lies in its ability to fairly compare and validate existing methods for new applications, as well as compare newly developed methods with existing ones. As a prototype for a more general framework, we have begun building a benchmark tool for the model order reduction (MOR) community. The data basis of the tool is the collection of the Model Order Reduction Wiki (MORWiki). The wiki features three main categories: benchmarks, methods, and software. An editorial board curates submissions and patrols edited entries. Data sets for linear and parametric-linear models are already well represented in the existing collection. Data sets for non-linear or procedural models, for which only evaluation data, or codes / algorithmic descriptions, rather than equations, are available, are being added and extended.

  abstract = {Numerical simulation of large-scale dynamical systems plays a fundamental role in studying a wide range of complex physical phenomena; however, the inherent large-scale nature of the models often leads to unmanageable demands on computational resources. Model reduction aims to reduce this computational burden by generating reduced models that are faster and cheaper to simulate, yet accurately represent the original large-scale system behavior. Model reduction of linear, nonparametric dynamical systems has reached a considerable level of maturity, as reflected by several survey papers and books. However, parametric model reduction has emerged only more recently as an important and vibrant research area, with several recent advances making a survey paper timely. Thus, this paper aims to provide a resource that draws together recent contributions in different communities to survey the state of the art in parametric model reduction methods.},

The scheme uses an implicit model description based on behavioral systems theory and past measured trajectories. In particular, it does not require any prior identification step, but only an initially measured input-output trajectory as well as an upper bound on the order of the unknown system. First, we prove exponential stability of a nominal data-driven MPC scheme with terminal equality constraints in the case of no measurement noise. For bounded additive output measurement noise, we propose a robust modification of the scheme, including a slack variable with regularization in the cost. We prove that the application of this robust MPC scheme in a multistep fashion leads to practical exponential stability of the closed loop w.r.t. the noise level. The presented results provide the first (theoretical) analysis of closed-loop properties, resulting from a simple, purely data-driven MPC scheme.},

  abstract = {We consider the solution of large stiff systems of ordinary differential equations with explicit exponential Runge--Kutta integrators. These problems arise from semi-discretized semi-linear parabolic partial differential equations on continuous domains or on inherently discrete graph domains. A series of results reduces the requirement of computing linear combinations of \${\textbackslash}varphi\$-functions in exponential integrators to the approximation of the action of a smaller number of matrix exponentials on certain vectors. State-of-the-art computational methods use polynomial Krylov subspaces of adaptive size for this task. They have the drawback that the required number of Krylov subspace iterations to obtain a desired tolerance increase drastically with the spectral radius of the discrete linear differential operator, e.g., the problem size. We present an approach that leverages rational Krylov subspace methods promising superior approximation qualities. We prove a novel a-posteriori error estimate of rational Krylov approximations to the action of the matrix exponential on vectors for single time points, which allows for an adaptive approach similar to existing polynomial Krylov techniques. We discuss pole selection and the efficient solution of the arising sequences of shifted linear systems by direct and preconditioned iterative solvers. Numerical experiments show that our method outperforms the state of the art for sufficiently large spectral radii of the discrete linear differential operators. The key to this are approximately constant numbers of rational Krylov iterations, which enable a near-linear scaling of the runtime with respect to the problem size.},

The Hermitian low-rank approximations \$X\_j\$ are of the form \$X\_j = Z\_jY\_jZ\_j\^H,\$ where \$Z\_j\$ is a matrix with only few columns and \$Y\_j\$ is a small square Hermitian matrix. Each \$X\_j\$ generates a low-rank Riccati residual \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{R\}(X\_j)\$ such that the norm of the residual can be evaluated easily allowing for an efficient termination criterion. Here a new family of methods to generate such low-rank approximate solutions \$X\_j\$ of CAREs is proposed. Each member of this family of algorithms proposed generates the same sequence of \$X\_j\$ as the four previously known algorithms. The approach is based on a block rational Arnoldi decomposition and an associated block rational Krylov subspace spanned by \$A\^H\$ and \$C\^H.\$ Two specific versions of the general algorithm will be considered; one will turn out to be equivalent to the RADI algorithm, the other one allows for a slightly more efficient implementation compared to the RADI algorithm.

  abstract = {Many machine learning approaches for decision making, such as reinforcement learning, rely on simulators or predictive models to forecast the time-evolution of quantities of interest, e.g., the state of an agent or the reward of a policy. Forecasts of such complex phenomena are commonly described by highly nonlinear dynamical systems, making their use in optimization-based decision-making challenging. Koopman operator theory offers a beneficial paradigm for addressing this problem by characterizing forecasts via linear time-invariant (LTI) ODEs -- turning multi-step forecasting into sparse matrix multiplications. Though there exists a variety of learning approaches, they usually lack crucial learning-theoretic guarantees, making the behavior of the obtained models with increasing data and dimensionality unclear. We address the aforementioned by deriving a novel reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) over trajectories that solely spans transformations into LTI dynamical systems. The resulting Koopman Kernel Regression (KKR) framework enables the use of statistical learning tools from function approximation for novel convergence results and generalization error bounds under weaker assumptions than existing work. Our experiments demonstrate superior forecasting performance compared to Koopman operator and sequential data predictors in RKHS.},

Also, Koopman operator theory has long-standing connections to known system-theoretic and dynamical system notions that are not universally recognized. Given the former and latter realities, this work aims to bridge the gap between various concepts regarding both theory and tractable realizations.

These system realizations are then used to determine the actuator location among the set that can drive the system output to an arbitrary value with minimal control effort. The solution of the corresponding minimum energy optimal control problem is evaluated by computing the generalized output controllability Gramian. We use the method to analyze high-fidelity numerical simulation data of the lift and separation angle responses to a pulse of localized body-force actuation from six distinct locations on the upper surface of a NACA 65(1)-412 airfoil. We find that the optimal location for controlling lift is different from the optimal location for controlling separation angle. In order to explain the physical mechanisms underlying these differences, we conduct controllability analyses of the flowfield by leveraging the dynamic mode decomposition with control algorithm. These modal analyses of flowfield response data reveal that excitation of coherent structures in the wake benefits lift control, whereas excitation of coherent structures in the shear layer benefits separation angle control.},

They are in one-to-one correspondence with positive definite maps called kernels. Stable RKHSs enjoy the additional property of containing only functions and absolutely integrable. Necessary and sufficient conditions for RKHS stability are known in the literature: the integral operator induced by the kernel must be bounded as map between \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{L\}\_\{{\textbackslash}infty\}\$, the space of essentially bounded (test) functions, and \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{L\}\_1\$, the space of absolutely integrable functions. Considering Mercer (continuous) kernels in continuous-time and the entire discrete-time class, we show that the stability test can be reduced to the study of the kernel operator over test functions which assume (almost everywhere) only the values \${\textbackslash}pm 1\$. They represent the same functions needed to investigate stability of any single element in the RKHS. In this way, the RKHS stability test becomes an elegant generalization of a straightforward result concerning Bounded-Input Bounded-Output (BIBO) stability of a single linear time-invariant system.},

To overcome the shortcomings of intrusive model order reduction usually derived by combining the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition and the Galerkin projection methods, we developed a novel technique on the basis of randomized dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) as a fast and accurate option in model order reduction. Our approach utilizes an adaptive randomized DMD to obtain a reduced basis in the offline stage, and then the temporal values of the reduced order model are obtained in the online stage through an interpolation using radial basis functions. The rank of the reduced DMD model is given as the unique solution of a constrained optimization problem. The Saint-Venant (shallow water) equations in a channel on the rotating earth are employed to provide the numerical data. We emphasize the excellent behavior of the nonintrusive reduced order model by performing a qualitative analysis. In addition, we gain a significantly reduction of CPU time in computation of the reduced order models compared with the classical DMD method.

  abstract = {We introduce the Weak-form Estimation of Nonlinear Dynamics (WENDy) method for estimating model parameters for non-linear systems of ODEs. The core mathematical idea involves an efficient conversion of the strong form representation of a model to its weak form, and then solving a regression problem to perform parameter inference. The core statistical idea rests on the Errors-In-Variables framework, which necessitates the use of the iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm. Further improvements are obtained by using orthonormal test functions, created from a set of \$C\^\{{\textbackslash}infty\}\$ bump functions of varying support sizes. We demonstrate that WENDy is a highly robust and efficient method for parameter inference in differential equations. Without relying on any numerical differential equation solvers, WENDy computes accurate estimates and is robust to large (biologically relevant) levels of measurement noise. For low dimensional systems with modest amounts of data, WENDy is competitive with conventional forward solver-based nonlinear least squares methods in terms of speed and accuracy. For both higher dimensional systems and stiff systems, WENDy is typically both faster (often by orders of magnitude) and more accurate than forward solver-based approaches. We illustrate the method and its performance in some common population and neuroscience models, including logistic growth, Lotka-Volterra, FitzHugh-Nagumo, Hindmarsh-Rose, and a Protein Transduction Benchmark model. Software and code for reproducing the examples is available at (https://github.com/MathBioCU/WENDy).},

Assuming a separation of time scales between the fast unstable mode and the slow transient evolution of the optimal perturbations, combined optimal perturbations that achieve the best balance between transient linear amplification and stabilisation of the nominal shear flow are determined. In the mixing layer with                                                                      \$\{{\textbackslash}it{\textbackslash}beta\}{\textbackslash}leqslant 1.5\$                                               , these combined optimal perturbations appear similar to transient growth-only optimal perturbations, and achieve a more efficient overall stabilisation than optimal spanwise-periodic and spanwise-invariant modifications computed for stabilisation only. These results are consistent with the efficiency of streak-based control strategies.},

  abstract = {A specific feature of three-dimensional bluff body wakes, flow bistability, is a subject of particular recent interest. This feature consists of a random flipping of the wake between two asymmetric configurations and is believed to contribute to the pressure drag of many bluff bodies. In this study we apply the modelling approach recently suggested for axisymmetric bodies by Rigas et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 778, 2015, R2) to the reflectional symmetry-breaking modes of a rectilinear bluff body wake. We demonstrate the validity of the model and its Reynolds number independence through time-resolved base pressure measurements of the natural wake. Further, oscillating flaps are used to investigate the dynamics and time scales of the instability associated with the flipping process, demonstrating that they are largely independent of Reynolds number. The modelling approach is then used to design a feedback controller that uses the flaps to suppress the symmetry-breaking modes. The controller is successful, leading to a suppression of the bistability of the wake, with concomitant reductions in both lateral and streamwise forces. Importantly, the controller is found to be efficient, the actuator requiring only 24 \% of the aerodynamic power saving. The controller therefore provides a key demonstration of efficient feedback control used to reduce the drag of a high-Reynolds-number three-dimensional bluff body. Furthermore, the results suggest that suppression of large-scale structures is a fundamentally efficient approach for bluff body drag reduction.},

In this work, we focus on a combination of delay-coordinates embedding and DMD, i.e., delay-coordinates DMD, which accommodates the analysis of a broad family of observations. An important utility of DMD is the compact and reduced-order spectral representation of observations in terms of the DMD eigenvalues and modes, where the temporal information is separated from the spatial information. From a spatiotemporal viewpoint, we show that when DMD is applied to delay-coordinates embedding, temporal information is intertwined with spatial information, inducing a particular spectral structure on the DMD components. We formulate and analyze this structure, which we term the spatiotemporal coupling in delay-coordinates DMD. Based on this spatiotemporal coupling, we propose a new method for DMD components selection. When using delay-coordinates DMD that comprises redundant modes, this selection is an essential step for obtaining a compact and reduced-order representation of the observations. We demonstrate our method on noisy simulated signals and various dynamical systems and show superior component selection compared to a commonly-used method that relies on the amplitudes of the modes.},

In particular, a complex-step approximation is used to achieve near analytical accuracy for the evaluation of the Jacobian matrix. Sensitivity maps for the sensitivity to base flow modifications and to a steady force are computed to identify regions of the flow field where an input could have a stabilising effect. Four test cases are presented: (1) an analytical test case to prove the theory of the discrete framework, (2) a lid-driven cavity at low Reynolds case to show the improved accuracy in the calculation of the eigenvalues when using the complex-step approximation, (3) the 2D flow past a circular cylinder at just below the critical Reynolds number used to validate the methodology, and finally, (4) the flow past an open cavity presented to give an example of the discrete method applied to a convectively unstable case. The latter three (2{\textendash}4) of the aforementioned cases were solved with the 2D compressible Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations using a Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element Method. Good agreement was obtained for the validation test case, (3), with appropriate results in the literature. Furthermore, it is shown that for the calculation of the direct and adjoint eigenmodes and their sensitivity maps to external perturbations, the use of complex variables is paramount for obtaining an accurate prediction.

This work combines delay embedding and Koopman theory to decompose chaotic dynamics into a linear model in the leading delay coordinates with forcing by low-energy delay coordinates; this is called the Hankel alternative view of Koopman (HAVOK) analysis. This analysis is applied to the Lorenz system and real-world examples including Earth's magnetic field reversal and measles outbreaks. In each case, forcing statistics are non-Gaussian, with long tails corresponding to rare intermittent forcing that precedes switching and bursting phenomena. The forcing activity demarcates coherent phase space regions where the dynamics are approximately linear from those that are strongly nonlinear.},

This work develops a novel framework to discover governing equations underlying a dynamical system simply from data measurements, leveraging advances in sparsity techniques and machine learning. The resulting models are parsimonious, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability while avoiding overfitting. There are many critical data-driven problems, such as understanding cognition from neural recordings, inferring climate patterns, determining stability of financial markets, predicting and suppressing the spread of disease, and controlling turbulence for greener transportation and energy. With abundant data and elusive laws, data-driven discovery of dynamics will continue to play an important role in these efforts.           ,              Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.},

  abstract = {The field of dynamical systems is being transformed by the mathematical tools and algorithms emerging from modern computing and data science. First-principles derivations and asymptotic reductions are giving way to data-driven approaches that formulate models in operator-theoretic or probabilistic frameworks. Koopman spectral theory has emerged as a dominant perspective over the past decade, in which nonlinear dynamics are represented in terms of an infinite-dimensional linear operator acting on the space of all possible measurement functions of the system. This linear representation of nonlinear dynamics has tremendous potential to enable the prediction, estimation, and control of nonlinear systems with standard textbook methods developed for linear systems. However, obtaining finite-dimensional coordinate systems and embeddings in which the dynamics appear approximately linear remains a central open challenge. The success of Koopman analysis is due primarily to three key factors: (1) there exists rigorous theory connecting it to classical geometric approaches for dynamical systems; (2) the approach is formulated in terms of measurements, making it ideal for leveraging big data and machine learning techniques; and (3) simple, yet powerful numerical algorithms, such as the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), have been developed and extended to reduce Koopman theory to practice in real-world applications. In this review, we provide an overview of modern Koopman operator theory, describing recent theoretical and algorithmic developments and highlighting these methods with a diverse range of applications. We also discuss key advances and challenges in the rapidly growing field of machine learning that are likely to drive future developments and significantly transform the theoretical landscape of dynamical systems.},

  abstract = {The reliable prediction of the temporal behavior of complex systems is key in numerous scientific fields. This strong interest is however hindered by modeling issues: often, the governing equations describing the physics of the system under consideration are not accessible or, if known, their solution might require a computational time incompatible with the prediction time constraints. Not surprisingly, approximating complex systems in a generic functional format and informing it ex-nihilo from available observations has become common practice in the age of machine learning, as illustrated by the numerous successful examples based on deep neural networks. However, generalizability of the models, margins of guarantee and the impact of data are often overlooked or examined mainly by relying on prior knowledge of the physics. We tackle these issues from a different viewpoint, by adopting a curriculum learning strategy. In curriculum learning, the dataset is structured such that the training process starts from simple samples towards more complex ones in order to favor convergence and generalization. The concept has been developed and successfully applied in robotics and control of systems. Here, we apply this concept for the learning of complex dynamical systems in a systematic way. First, leveraging insights from the ergodic theory, we assess the amount of data sufficient for a-priori guaranteeing a faithful model of the physical system and thoroughly investigate the impact of the training set and its structure on the quality of long-term predictions. Based on that, we consider entropy as a metric of complexity of the dataset; we show how an informed design of the training set based on the analysis of the entropy significantly improves the resulting models in terms of generalizability, and provide insights on the amount and the choice of data required for an effective data-driven modeling.},

At first, the influence of the Reynolds number and the ratio of the boundary layer's thickness to roughness height on the three-dimensional spatiotemporal (global) stability of the flow has been investigated. Depending on the operating conditions, the leading instability can either be varicose (symmetric) or sinuous (antisymmetric). In both cases, when the flow is excited by broadband frequency forcing, dynamic mode decomposition extracts only varicose coherent structures even though optimal response analysis predicts a strong amplification of sinuous disturbances having frequency close to that of the marginally stable sinuous eigenmode. This apparent discrepancy is attributed to the fact that the sinuous instability is sensitive to a very limited range of frequencies barely excited by freestream turbulence while varicose disturbances are associated with high amplification in a much wider frequency range. Hence, in this case the flow behaves as an amplifier of varicose perturbations rather than a resonator. Consequences on the subsequent transition to turbulence have been studied, highlighting that varicose perturbations extract energy from the near-wake region, get continuously amplified due to the excitation provided by freestream turbulence, and eventually give rise to a shedding of hairpin vortices.},

  abstract = {The onset of unsteadiness in a boundary-layer flow past a cylindrical roughness element is investigated for three flow configurations at subcritical Reynolds numbers, both experimentally and numerically. On the one hand, a quasi-periodic shedding of hairpin vortices is observed for all configurations in the experiment. On the other hand, global stability analyses have revealed the existence of a varicose isolated mode, as well as of a sinuous one, both being linearly stable. Nonetheless, the isolated stable varicose modes are highly sensitive, as ascertained by pseudospectrum analysis. To investigate how these modes might influence the dynamics of the flow, an optimal forcing analysis is performed. The optimal response consists of a varicose perturbation closely related to the least stable varicose isolated eigenmode and induces dynamics similar to that observed experimentally. The quasi-resonance of such a global mode to external forcing might thus be responsible for the onset of unsteadiness at subcritical Reynolds numbers, hence providing a simple explanation for the experimental observations.},

  abstract = {This paper is motivated by sensor location problems for infinite dimensional linear distributed parameter systems (DPS) defined by partial differential equations (PDEs). In this setting the term ``sensor location'' usually refers to a spatial location. However, the problem is also meaningful in finite dimensional models and results in a parameterization of the system output matrix. The problem of ``optimal'' sensor (and actuator) location has a long history and plays an important role in controller design, system identification and state estimation and, depending on the application, can be formulated in many ways. Any optimal location problem implies that there is a cost function to be minimized and the choice of this cost function places specific requirements on the computational methods needed to solve the problem. In addition, as shown in the papers Yang and Morris [2014, 2015] choices such as ``optimizing observability'' can lead to ill-posed problems and result in non convergence of suboptimal placements. On the other hand, minimum error variance methods (Kalman filtering) can be shown be well-posed. Efficient computational methods for solving the corresponding Riccati partial differential equation have been developed and are readily available. In the classic paper by Luenberger [1964], he introduced the term ``observer'' for deterministic state estimation to distinguish it from the Kalman filter. In this paper we focus on state estimators based on the Luenberger observer and suggest some natural cost functions for sensor location. The framework is fairly general and applies to both finite and infinite dimensional systems. Examples are given to illustrate the ideas.},

  abstract = {In many industrial applications, obtaining labeled observations is not straightforward as it often requires the intervention of human experts or the use of expensive testing equipment. In these circumstances, active learning can be highly beneficial in suggesting the most informative data points to be used when fitting a model. Reducing the number of observations needed for model development alleviates both the computational burden required for training and the operational expenses related to labeling. Online active learning, in particular, is useful in high-volume production processes where the decision about the acquisition of the label for a data point needs to be taken within an extremely short time frame. However, despite the recent efforts to develop online active learning strategies, the behavior of these methods in the presence of outliers has not been thoroughly examined. In this work, we investigate the performance of online active linear regression in contaminated data streams. Our study shows that the currently available query strategies are prone to sample outliers, whose inclusion in the training set eventually degrades the predictive performance of the models. To address this issue, we propose a solution that bounds the search area of a conditional D-optimal algorithm and uses a robust estimator. Our approach strikes a balance between exploring unseen regions of the input space and protecting against outliers. Through numerical simulations, we show that the proposed method is effective in improving the performance of online active learning in the presence of outliers, thus expanding the potential applications of this powerful tool.},

Turbulence is notoriously challenging, in part due to its multiscale nature and the fact that large-scale coherent structures cannot be disentangled from small-scale fluctuations. This closure problem is emblematic of a greater challenge in complex systems, where coarse-graining and statistical mechanics descriptions break down. This work demonstrates an alternative data-driven modeling approach to learn nonlinear models of the coherent structures, approximating turbulent fluctuations as state-dependent stochastic forcing. We demonstrate this approach on a high{\textendash}Reynolds number turbulent wake experiment, showing that our model reproduces empirical power spectra and probability distributions. The model is interpretable, providing insights into the physical mechanisms underlying the symmetry-breaking behavior in the wake. This work suggests a path toward low-dimensional models of globally unstable turbulent flows from experimental measurements, with broad implications for other multiscale systems.           ,              A low-dimensional data-driven model captures the dominant dynamics in a turbulent flow.},

Reduced-order models based on Galerkin projection of the governing equations onto an orthogonal modal basis approximate the flow as a low-dimensional dynamical system with linear and quadratic terms. However, these Galerkin models often fail to reproduce the true dynamics, in part because they ignore important nonlinear interactions with unresolved flow scales. Here, we use a separation of time scales between the resolved and subscale variables to derive a reduced-order model with cubic closure terms for the truncated modes, generalizing the classic Stuart-Landau equation. The leading order cubic terms are determined by averaging out fast variables through a perturbation series approximation of the action of a stochastic Koopman operator. We show analytically that this multiscale closure model can capture both the effects of mean-flow deformation and the energy cascade before demonstrating improved stability and accuracy in models of chaotic lid-driven cavity flow and vortex pairing in a mixing layer. This approach to closure modeling establishes a general theory for the origin and role of cubic nonlinearities in low-dimensional models of incompressible flows},

However, even when the microscopic governing equations and qualitative macroscopic behaviour are known, it is often difficult to derive a stochastic model that is consistent with observations. This is especially true for systems such as turbulence where the perturbations do not behave like Gaussian white noise, introducing non-Markovian behaviour to the dynamics. We address these challenges with a framework for identifying interpretable stochastic nonlinear dynamics from experimental data, using forward and adjoint Fokker{\textendash}Planck equations to enforce statistical consistency. If the form of the Langevin equation is unknown, a simple sparsifying procedure can provide an appropriate functional form. We demonstrate that this method can learn stochastic models in two artificial examples: recovering a nonlinear Langevin equation forced by coloured noise and approximating the second-order dynamics of a particle in a double-well potential with the corresponding first-order bifurcation normal form. Finally, we apply Langevin regression to experimental measurements of a turbulent bluff body wake and show that the statistical behaviour of the centre of pressure can be described by the dynamics of the corresponding laminar flow driven by nonlinear state-dependent noise.},

Current methods in flow estimation often use least squares regression to reconstruct the flow field, finding the minimum-energy solution that is consistent with the measured data. However, this approach may be prone to overfitting and sensitive to noise. To address these challenges we instead seek a sparse representation of the data in a library of examples. Sparse representation has been widely used for image recognition and reconstruction, and it is well-suited to structured data with limited, corrupt measurements. We explore sparse representation for flow reconstruction on a variety of fluid data sets with a wide range of complexity, including vortex shedding past a cylinder at low Reynolds number, a mixing layer, and two geophysical flows. In addition, we compare several measurement strategies and consider various types of noise and corruption over a range of intensities. We find that sparse representation has considerably improved the estimation accuracy and robustness to noise and corruption compared with least squares methods. We also introduce a sparse estimation procedure on local spatial patches for complex multiscale flows that preclude a global sparse representation. Based on these results, sparse representation is a promising framework for extracting useful information from complex flow fields with realistic measurements.},

Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) provides an energy-optimal linear basis to represent the flow kinematics, but converges slowly for advection-dominated flows and tends to overestimate the number of dynamically relevant variables. We show that nonlinear correlations in the temporal POD coefficients can be exploited to identify the underlying attractor, characterized by a minimal set of driving modes and a manifold equation for the remaining modes. By viewing these nonlinear correlations as an invariant manifold reduction, this least-order representation can be used to stabilize POD-Galerkin models or as a state space for data-driven model identification. In the latter case, we use sparse polynomial regression to learn a compact, interpretable dynamical system model from the time series of the active modal coefficients. We demonstrate this perspective on a quasiperiodic shear-driven cavity flow and show that the dynamics evolve on a torus generated by two independent Stuart-Landau oscillators. These results emphasize the importance of nonlinear dimensionality reduction to reveal underlying structure in complex flows.},

  abstract = {A dimension reduction method called discrete empirical interpolation is proposed and shown to dramatically reduce the computational complexity of the popular proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method for constructing reduced-order models for unsteady and/or parametrized nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). In the presence of a general nonlinearity, the standard POD-Galerkin technique reduces dimension in the sense that far fewer variables are present, but the complexity of evaluating the nonlinear term remains that of the original problem. Empirical interpolation posed in finite dimensional function space is a modification of POD that reduces complexity of the nonlinear term of the reduced model to a cost proportional to the number of reduced variables obtained by POD. We propose a discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM), a variant that is suitable for reducing the dimension of systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of a certain type. As presented here, it is applicable to ODEs arising from finite difference discretization of unsteady time dependent PDE and/or parametrically dependent steady state problems. However, the approach extends to arbitrary systems of nonlinear ODEs with minor modification. Our contribution is a greatly simplified description of EIM in a finite dimensional setting that possesses an error bound on the quality of approximation. An application of DEIM to a finite difference discretization of the 1-D FitzHugh-Nagumo equations is shown to reduce the dimension from 1024 to order 5 variables with negligible error over a long-time integration that fully captured non-linear limit cycle behavior. We also demonstrate applicability in higher spatial dimensions with similar state space dimension reduction and accuracy results.},

In existing a posteriori error estimation approaches, knowledge about the time integration scheme is mandatory, e.g., the residual-based error estimators proposed for the reduced basis method. This poses a challenge when automatic ordinary differential equation solver libraries are used to perform the time integration. To address this, we present a data-enhanced approach for a posteriori error estimation. Our new formulation enables residual-based error estimators to be independent of any time integration method. To achieve this, we introduce a corrected reduced-order model which takes into account a data-driven closure term for improved accuracy. The closure term, subject to mild assumptions, is related to the local truncation error of the corresponding time integration scheme. We propose efficient computational schemes for approximating the closure term, at the cost of a modest amount of training data. Furthermore, the new error estimator is incorporated within a greedy process to obtain parametric reduced-order models. Numerical results on three different systems show the accuracy of the proposed error estimation approach and its ability to produce ROMs that generalize well.},

This results in a dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)-like ROM that allows for a probabilistic forecast of the unsampled, future trajectory of the dynamic model. At an unsampled trial parameter, the ROM is constructed by interpolating a set of sampled ROMs probabilistically, thereby allowing for parameterization of the ROM with intrinsic uncertainty estimates in time, in space and in the parameter domain. An adaptive sampling strategy is further proposed to optimize the selection of the parameter locations, where the snapshots are collected.

We formulate the gradient of the H2 squared norm with respect to the actuator and sensor placements and iterate towards the optimal placement. When stochastic flow disturbances are present everywhere in the spatial domain, it is optimal to place the actuator just upstream of the origin and the sensor just downstream. With pairs of actuators and sensors, it is optimal to place each actuator slightly upstream of each corresponding sensor, and scatter the pairs throughout the spatial domain. When disturbances are only introduced upstream, the optimal placement shifts upstream as well. Global mode and Gramian analyses fail to predict the optimal placement; they produce H2 norms about five times higher than at the true optimum.

It analyzes empirical data, typically generated by nonlinear dynamics, and computes eigenvalues and eigenmodes of an approximate linear model. Without explicit knowledge of the dynamical operator, it extracts frequencies, growth rates, and spatial structures for each mode. We show that expansion in DMD modes is unique under certain conditions. When constructing mode-based reduced-order models of partial differential equations, subtracting a mean from the data set is typically necessary to satisfy boundary conditions. Subtracting the mean of the data exactly reduces DMD to the temporal discrete Fourier transform (DFT); this is restrictive and generally undesirable. On the other hand, subtracting an equilibrium point generally preserves the DMD spectrum and modes. Next, we introduce an ``optimized'' DMD that computes an arbitrary number of dynamical modes from a data set. Compared to DMD, optimized DMD is superior at calculating physically relevant frequencies, and is less numerically sensitive. We test these decomposition methods on data from a two-dimensional cylinder fluid flow at a Reynolds number of~60. Time-varying modes computed from the DMD variants yield low projection errors.},

The effectiveness of SINDy hinges on the choice of candidate functions within its dictionary to extract governing equations of dynamical systems. A larger dictionary allows for more terms, enhancing the quality of approximations. However, the computational complexity scales with dictionary size, rendering SINDy less suitable for high-dimensional datasets, even though it has been successfully applied to low-dimensional datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce iterative SINDy in this paper, where the dictionary undergoes expansion and compression through iterations. We also conduct an analysis of the convergence properties of iterative SINDy. Simulation results validate that iterative SINDy can achieve nearly identical performance to SINDy, while significantly reducing computational complexity. Notably, iterative SINDy demonstrates effectiveness with high-dimensional time-series data without incurring the prohibitively high computational cost associated with SINDy.},

This report presents our not-so-successful experiments of solving the Navier-Stokes equations with PINN as a replacement for traditional solvers. We aim to, with our experiments, prepare readers for the challenges they may face if they are interested in data-free PINN. In this work, we used two standard flow problems: 2D Taylor-Green vortex at Re=100 and 2D cylinder flow at Re=200. The PINN method solved the 2D Taylor-Green vortex problem with acceptable results, and we used this flow as an accuracy and performance benchmark. About 32 hours of training were required for the PINN method's accuracy to match the accuracy of a 16x16 finite-difference simulation, which took less than 20 seconds. The 2D cylinder flow, on the other hand, did not produce a physical solution. The PINN method behaved like a steady-flow solver and did not capture the vortex shedding phenomenon. By sharing our experience, we would like to emphasize that the PINN method is still a work-in-progress, especially in terms of solving flow problems without any given data. More work is needed to make PINN feasible for real-world problems in such applications.},

  abstract = {The recent surge of interest in physics-informed neural network (PINN) methods has led to a wave of studies that attest to their potential for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) and predicting the dynamics of physical systems. However, the predictive limitations of PINNs have not been thoroughly investigated. We look at the flow around a 2D cylinder and find that data-free PINNs are unable to predict vortex shedding. Data-driven PINN exhibits vortex shedding only while the training data (from a traditional CFD solver) is available, but reverts to the steady state solution when the data flow stops. We conducted dynamic mode decomposition and analyze the Koopman modes in the solutions obtained with PINNs versus a traditional fluid solver (PetIBM). The distribution of the Koopman eigenvalues on the complex plane suggests that PINN is numerically dispersive and diffusive. The PINN method reverts to the steady solution possibly as a consequence of spectral bias. This case study reaises concerns about the ability of PINNs to predict flows with instabilities, specifically vortex shedding. Our computational study supports the need for more theoretical work to analyze the numerical properties of PINN methods.

However, Koopman operators are infinite-dimensional, and computing their spectral information is a considerable challenge. We introduce measure-preserving extended dynamic mode decomposition (\${\textbackslash}texttt\{mpEDMD\}\$), the first truncation method whose eigendecomposition converges to the spectral quantities of Koopman operators for general measure-preserving dynamical systems. \${\textbackslash}texttt\{mpEDMD\}\$ is a data-driven algorithm based on an orthogonal Procrustes problem that enforces measure-preserving truncations of Koopman operators using a general dictionary of observables. It is flexible and easy to use with any pre-existing DMD-type method, and with different types of data. We prove convergence of \${\textbackslash}texttt\{mpEDMD\}\$ for projection-valued and scalar-valued spectral measures, spectra, and Koopman mode decompositions. For the case of delay embedding (Krylov subspaces), our results include the first convergence rates of the approximation of spectral measures as the size of the dictionary increases. We demonstrate \${\textbackslash}texttt\{mpEDMD\}\$ on a range of challenging examples, its increased robustness to noise compared with other DMD-type methods, and its ability to capture the energy conservation and cascade of experimental measurements of a turbulent boundary layer flow with Reynolds number \${$>$} 6{\textbackslash}times 10\^4\$ and state-space dimension \${$>$}10\^5\$.},

  abstract = {Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) describes complex dynamic processes through a hierarchy of simpler coherent features. DMD is regularly used to understand the fundamental characteristics of turbulence and is closely related to Koopman operators. However, verifying the decomposition, equivalently the computed spectral features of Koopman operators, remains a major challenge due to the infinite-dimensional nature of Koopman operators. Challenges include spurious (unphysical) modes, and dealing with continuous spectra, both of which occur regularly in turbulent flows. Residual Dynamic Mode Decomposition (ResDMD), introduced by (Colbrook \& Townsend 2021), overcomes some of these challenges through the data-driven computation of residuals associated with the full infinite-dimensional Koopman operator. ResDMD computes spectra and pseudospectra of general Koopman operators with error control, and computes smoothed approximations of spectral measures (including continuous spectra) with explicit high-order convergence theorems. ResDMD thus provides robust and verified Koopmanism. We implement ResDMD and demonstrate its application in a variety of fluid dynamic situations, at varying Reynolds numbers, arising from both numerical and experimental data. Examples include: vortex shedding behind a cylinder; hot-wire data acquired in a turbulent boundary layer; particle image velocimetry data focusing on a wall-jet flow; and acoustic pressure signals of laser-induced plasma. We present some advantages of ResDMD, namely, the ability to verifiably resolve non-linear, transient modes, and spectral calculation with reduced broadening effects. We also discuss how a new modal ordering based on residuals enables greater accuracy with a smaller dictionary than the traditional modulus ordering. This paves the way for greater dynamic compression of large datasets without sacrificing accuracy.},

  abstract = {High-fidelity numerical simulations of partial differential equations (PDEs) given a restricted computational budget can significantly limit the number of parameter configurations considered and/or time window evaluated for modeling a given system. Multi-fidelity surrogate modeling aims to leverage less accurate, lower-fidelity models that are computationally inexpensive in order to enhance predictive accuracy when high-fidelity data are limited or scarce. However, low-fidelity models, while often displaying important qualitative spatio-temporal features, fail to accurately capture the onset of instability and critical transients observed in the high-fidelity models, making them impractical as surrogate models. To address this shortcoming, we present a new data-driven strategy that combines dimensionality reduction with multi-fidelity neural network surrogates. The key idea is to generate a spatial basis by applying the classical proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) to high-fidelity solution snapshots, and approximate the dynamics of the reduced states - time-parameter-dependent expansion coefficients of the POD basis - using a multi-fidelity long-short term memory (LSTM) network. By mapping low-fidelity reduced states to their high-fidelity counterpart, the proposed reduced-order surrogate model enables the efficient recovery of full solution fields over time and parameter variations in a non-intrusive manner. The generality and robustness of this method is demonstrated by a collection of parametrized, time-dependent PDE problems where the low-fidelity model can be defined by coarser meshes and/or time stepping, as well as by misspecified physical features. Importantly, the onset of instabilities and transients are well captured by this surrogate modeling technique.},

Therefore, constructing efficient reduced order models (ROMs) that enable accurate but fast predictions, while retaining the dynamical characteristics of the physical phenomenon as parameters vary, is of paramount importance. In this work, a data-driven, non-intrusive framework which combines ROM construction with reduced dynamics identification, is presented. Starting from a limited amount of full order solutions, the proposed approach leverages autoencoder neural networks with parametric sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) to construct a low-dimensional dynamical model. This model can be queried to efficiently compute full-time solutions at new parameter instances, as well as directly fed to continuation algorithms. These aim at tracking the evolution of periodic steady-state responses as functions of system parameters, avoiding the computation of the transient phase, and allowing to detect instabilities and bifurcations. Featuring an explicit and parametrized modeling of the reduced dynamics, the proposed data-driven framework presents remarkable capabilities to generalize with respect to both time and parameters. Applications to structural mechanics and fluid dynamics problems illustrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method.},

To address these difficulties, we detail an approach based on local linear models within windows determined adaptively from data. While the dynamics within each window are simple, consisting of exponential decay, growth, and oscillations, the collection of local parameters across all windows provides a principled characterization of the full time series. To explore the resulting model space, we develop a likelihood-based hierarchical clustering, and we examine the eigenvalues of the linear dynamics. We demonstrate our analysis with the Lorenz system undergoing stable spiral dynamics and in the standard chaotic regime. Applied to the posture dynamics of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, our approach identifies fine-grained behavioral states and model dynamics which fluctuate about an instability boundary, and we detail a bifurcation in a transition from forward to backward crawling. We analyze whole-brain imaging in C. elegans and show that global brain dynamics is damped away from the instability boundary by a decrease in oxygen concentration. We provide additional evidence for such near-critical dynamics from the analysis of electrocorticography in monkey and the imaging of a neural population from mouse visual cortex at single-cell resolution.},

Unfortunately, the subset selection problem for detection under dependent observations is combinatorial in nature and suboptimal subset selection algorithms must be employed. In this work, different from the widely used convex relaxation of the problem, we leverage submodularity, the diminishing returns property, to provide practical near optimal algorithms suitable for large-scale subset selection. This is achieved by means of low-complexity greedy algorithms, which incur a reduced computational complexity compared to their convex counterparts.},

  abstract = {Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) provides a practical means of extracting insightful dynamical information from fluids datasets. Like any data processing technique, DMD's usefulness is limited by its ability to extract real and accurate dynamical features from noise-corrupted data. Here, we show analytically that DMD is biased to sensor noise, and quantify how this bias depends on the size and noise level of the data. We present three modifications to DMD that can be used to remove this bias: (1) a direct correction of the identified bias using known noise properties, (2) combining the results of performing DMD forwards and backwards in time, and (3) a total least-squares-inspired algorithm. We discuss the relative merits of each algorithm and demonstrate the performance of these modifications on a range of synthetic, numerical, and experimental datasets. We further compare our modified DMD algorithms with other variants proposed in the recent literature.},

  abstract = {We experimentally perform open and closed-loop control of a separating turbulent boundary layer downstream from a sharp edge ramp. The turbulent boundary layer just above the separation point has a Reynolds number \$\$Re\_\{{\textbackslash}theta \}{\textbackslash}approx 3500\$\$based on momentum thickness. The goal of the control is to mitigate separation and early re-attachment. The forcing employs a spanwise array of active vortex generators. The flow state is monitored with skin-friction sensors downstream of the actuators. The feedback control law is obtained using model-free genetic programming control (GPC) (Gautier et al. in J Fluid Mech 770:442{\textendash}457, 2015). The resulting flow is assessed using the momentum coefficient, pressure distribution and skin friction over the ramp and stereo PIV. The PIV yields vector field statistics, e.g. shear layer growth, the back-flow area and vortex region. GPC is benchmarked against the best periodic forcing. While open-loop control achieves separation reduction by locking-on the shedding mode, GPC gives rise to similar benefits by accelerating the shear layer growth. Moreover, GPC uses less actuation energy.},

  abstract = {This work presents a novel methodology for analysis and control of nonlinear fluid systems using neural networks. The approach is demonstrated on four different study cases being the Lorenz system, a modified version of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, a streamwise-periodic 2D channel flow, and a confined cylinder flow. Neural networks are trained as models to capture the complex system dynamics and estimate equilibrium points through a Newton method, enabled by backpropagation. These neural network surrogate models (NNSMs) are leveraged to train a second neural network, which is designed to act as a stabilizing closed-loop controller. The training process employs a recurrent approach, whereby the NNSM and the neural network controller (NNC) are chained in closed loop along a finite time horizon. By cycling through phases of combined random open-loop actuation and closed-loop control, an iterative training process is introduced to overcome the lack of data near equilibrium points. This approach improves the accuracy of the models in the most critical region for achieving stabilization. Through the use of L1 regularization within loss functions, the NNSMs can also guide optimal sensor placement, reducing the number of sensors from an initial candidate set. The datasets produced during the iterative training process are also leveraged for conducting a linear stability analysis through a modified dynamic mode decomposition approach. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of computationally inexpensive neural networks in modeling, controlling, and enabling stability analysis of nonlinear systems, providing insights into the system behaviour and offering potential for stabilization of complex fluid systems.},

A core challenge is to shape and maintain a high-temperature plasma within the tokamak vessel. This requires high-dimensional, high-frequency, closed-loop control using magnetic actuator coils, further complicated by the diverse requirements across a wide range of plasma configurations. In this work, we introduce a previously undescribed architecture for tokamak magnetic controller design that autonomously learns to command the full set of control coils. This architecture meets control objectives specified at a high level, at the same time satisfying physical and operational constraints. This approach has unprecedented flexibility and generality in problem specification and yields a notable reduction in design effort to produce new plasma configurations. We successfully produce and control a diverse set of plasma configurations on the Tokamak {\`a} Configuration Variable               1,2               , including elongated, conventional shapes, as well as advanced configurations, such as negative triangularity and `snowflake' configurations. Our approach achieves accurate tracking of the location, current and shape for these configurations. We also demonstrate sustained `droplets' on TCV, in which two separate plasmas are maintained simultaneously within the vessel. This represents a notable advance for tokamak feedback control, showing the potential of reinforcement learning to accelerate research in the fusion domain, and is one of the most challenging real-world systems to which reinforcement learning has been applied.},

CA techniques are appealing because many can be formulated as eigen-problems, offering great potential for learning linear and nonlinear representations of data in closed-form. However, the eigen-formulation often conceals important analytic and computational drawbacks of CA techniques, such as solving generalized eigen-problems with rank deficient matrices (e.g., small sample size problem), lacking intuitive interpretation of normalization factors, and understanding commonalities and differences between CA methods. This paper proposes a unified least-squares framework to formulate many CA methods. We show how PCA, LDA, CCA, LPP, SC, and its kernel and regularized extensions correspond to a particular instance of least-squares weighted kernel reduced rank regression (LS-WKRRR). The LS-WKRRR formulation of CA methods has several benefits: 1) provides a clean connection between many CA techniques and an intuitive framework to understand normalization factors; 2) yields efficient numerical schemes to solve CA techniques; 3) overcomes the small sample size problem; 4) provides a framework to easily extend CA methods. We derive weighted generalizations of PCA, LDA, SC, and CCA, and several new CA techniques.},

Such generalized inverses are famously represented by the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse (MPP) which happens to minimize the Frobenius norm. Freeing up the degrees of freedom associated with Frobenius optimality enables us to promote other interesting properties. In this Part I, we look at the basic properties of norm-minimizing generalized inverses, especially in terms of uniqueness and relation to the MPP. We first show that the MPP minimizes many norms beyond those unitarily invariant, thus further bolstering its role as a robust choice in many situations. We then concentrate on some norms which are generally not minimized by the MPP, but whose minimization is relevant for linear inverse problems and sparse representations. In particular, we look at mixed norms and the induced \${\textbackslash}ell\^p {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}ell\^q\$ norms. An interesting representative is the sparse pseudoinverse which we study in much more detail in Part II. Next, we shift attention from norms to matrices with interesting behaviors. We exhibit a class whose generalized inverse is always the MPP-even for norms that normally result in different inverses-and a class for which many generalized inverses coincide, but not with the MPP. Finally, we discuss efficient computation of norm-minimizing generalized inverses.},

For many practical problems of interest, discretizing these PDEs results in massive matrix differential equations (MDEs) that are too expensive to solve using conventional methods. While TDB ROMs have the potential to significantly reduce this computational burden, they still suffer from the following challenges: (i) inefficient for general nonlinearities, (ii) intrusive implementation, (iii) ill-conditioned in the presence of small singular values and (iv) error accumulation due to fixed rank. To this end, we present a scalable method for solving TDB ROMs that is computationally efficient, minimally intrusive, robust in the presence of small singular values, rank-adaptive and highly parallelizable. These favourable properties are achieved via oblique projections that require evaluating the MDE at a small number of rows and columns. The columns and rows are selected using the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM), which yields near-optimal matrix low-rank approximations. We show that the proposed algorithm is equivalent to a CUR matrix decomposition. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency and robustness of the new method for a diverse set of problems.},

  abstract = {A crucial challenge encountered in diverse areas of engineering applications involves speculating the governing equations based upon partial observations. On this basis, a variant of the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm is developed. First, the Akaike information criterion (AIC) is integrated to enforce model selection by hierarchically ranking the most informative model from several manageable candidate models. This integration avoids restricting the number of candidate models, which is a disadvantage of the traditional methods for model selection. The subsequent procedure expands the structure of dynamics from ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to partial differential equations (PDEs), while group sparsity is employed to identify the nonconstant coefficients of partial differential equations. Of practical consideration within an integrated frame is data processing, which tends to treat noise separate from signals and tends to parametrize the noise probability distribution. In particular, the coefficients of a species of canonical ODEs and PDEs, such as the Van der Pol, R{\"o}ssler, Burgers' and Kuramoto{\textendash}Sivashinsky equations, can be identified correctly with the introduction of noise. Furthermore, except for normal noise, the proposed approach is able to capture the distribution of uniform noise. In accordance with the results of the experiments, the computational speed is markedly advanced and possesses robustness.},

We build upon Fourier-based spectral methods, which are considerably more efficient than other numerical schemes for simulating PDEs with smooth and periodic solutions.

The proposed framework is based on the combination of machine learning tools: dimensionality reduction to extract dominant spatial directions from data, reconstruction algorithm to recover encoded data by limited measurements and cross-validation for hyperparameter optimization. For the encoding part, linear and nonlinear extraction of patterns are considered: proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), linear autoencoder (LAE) and variational autoencoder (VAE). For the reconstruction part, regressive reconstruction (neural network, linear, support vector, gradient boosting) and library-based reconstruction are compared, each method being cross-validated to ensure good generalization on testing data. The position of sensors is optimized using an enhanced clustering algorithm. The robustness of regressive reconstructions to noise measurements is also addressed, showing the benefits of variational approaches in the reduction phase. The strategy is tested for three increasing complexity flows: 2D vortex shedding (Re=200), 2D spatial mixing layer and 3D vortex shedding (Re=20000). The results suggest that proper machine learning approaches to fluid flow data can lead to effective reconstruction models that can be used for the rapid estimation of complex flows.},

  abstract = {Delay embeddings of time series data have emerged as a promising coordinate basis for data-driven estimation of the Koopman operator, which seeks a linear representation for observed nonlinear dynamics. Recent work has demonstrated the efficacy of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) for obtaining finite-dimensional Koopman approximations in delay coordinates. In this paper we demonstrate how nonlinear dynamics with sparse Fourier spectra can be (i) represented by a superposition of principal component trajectories and (ii) modeled by DMD in this coordinate space. For continuous or mixed (discrete and continuous) spectra, DMD can be augmented with an external forcing term. We present a method for learning linear control models in delay coordinates while simultaneously discovering the corresponding exogenous forcing signal in a fully unsupervised manner. This extends the existing DMD with control (DMDc) algorithm to cases where a control signal is not known a priori. We provide examples to validate the learned forcing against a known ground truth and illustrate their statistical similarity. Finally, we offer a demonstration of this method applied to real-world power grid load data to show its utility for diagnostics and interpretation on systems in which somewhat periodic behavior is strongly forced by unknown and unmeasurable environmental variables.},

Optimally controlling such out-of-equilibrium systems is a crucial yet challenging task with applications to quantum technologies and devices. We introduce a general model-free framework based on Reinforcement Learning to identify out-of-equilibrium thermodynamic cycles that are Pareto optimal trade-offs between power and efficiency for quantum heat engines and refrigerators. The method does not require any knowledge of the quantum thermal machine, nor of the system model, nor of the quantum state. Instead, it only observes the heat fluxes, so it is both applicable to simulations and experimental devices. We test our method on a model of an experimentally realistic refrigerator based on a superconducting qubit, and on a heat engine based on a quantum harmonic oscillator. In both cases, we identify the Pareto-front representing optimal power-efficiency trade-offs, and the corresponding cycles. Such solutions outperform previous proposals made in literature, such as optimized Otto cycles, reducing quantum friction.},

Randomized algorithms are emerging techniques to compute low-rank matrix approximations at a fraction of the cost of deterministic algorithms, easing the computational challenges arising in the area of `big data'. The idea is to derive a small matrix from the highdimensional data, which is then used to efficiently compute the dynamic modes and eigenvalues. The algorithm is presented in a modular probabilistic framework, and the approximation quality can be controlled via oversampling and power iterations. The effectiveness of the resulting randomized DMD algorithm is demonstrated on several benchmark examples of increasing complexity, providing an accurate and efficient approach to extract spatiotemporal coherent structures from big data in a framework that scales with the intrinsic rank of the data, rather than the ambient measurement dimension. For this work we assume that the dynamics of the problem under consideration is evolving on a low-dimensional subspace that is well characterized by a fast decaying singular value spectrum.},

An approximate eigensystem procedure that only needs the Frechet derivative is used to extract the least damped eigenmodes. The overall method has been applied to the case of transonic flow past an airfoil and has revealed that the most persistent transient modes are highly structured and are associated with eigenvalues of small modulus.

TPLS is at its heart a two-phase flow solver, and uses calls to a range of external libraries to accelerate its performance. However, in the present context we narrow the focus of the study to basic hydrodynamics and parallel computing techniques, and the code is therefore simplified and modified to simulate pressure-driven single-phase flow in a channel, using only relatively simple Fortran 90 code with MPI parallelization, but no calls to any other external libraries. The modified code is analysed in order to both validate its accuracy and investigate its scalability up to 1000 CPU cores. Simulations are performed for several benchmark cases in pressure-driven channel flow, including a turbulent simulation, wherein the turbulence is incorporated via the large-eddy simulation technique.

More broadly, RL-guided active control can lead to efficient exploration of additional flow-control strategies in experimental fluid mechanics, potentially paving the way for accelerating scientific discovery and different designs in flow-related engineering problems.                        ,              We have demonstrated the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) in bluff body flow control problems both in experiments and simulations by automatically discovering active control strategies for drag reduction in turbulent flow.

By properly defining rewards and designing noise reduction techniques, and after an automatic sequence of tens of towing experiments, the RL agent was shown to discover a control strategy that is comparable to the optimal strategy found through lengthy systematically planned control experiments. Subsequently, these results were verified by simulations that enabled us to gain insight into the physical mechanisms of the drag reduction process. While RL has been used effectively previously in idealized computer flow simulation studies, this study demonstrates its effectiveness in experimental fluid mechanics and verifies it by simulations, potentially paving the way for efficient exploration of additional active flow control strategies in other complex fluid mechanics applications.},

  abstract = {Resolvent analysis is a powerful tool for studying coherent structures in turbulent flows. However, its application beyond canonical flows with symmetries that can be used to simplify the problem to inherently three-dimensional flows and other large systems has been hindered by the computational cost of computing resolvent modes. In particular, the CPU and memory requirements of state-of-the-art algorithms scale poorly with the problem dimension, i.e., the number of discrete degrees of freedom. In this paper, we present RSVD-\${\textbackslash}Delta t\$, a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by combining randomized singular value decomposition with an optimized time-stepping method for computing the action of the resolvent operator. Critically, the CPU cost and memory requirements of the algorithm scale linearly with the problem dimension, and we develop additional strategies to minimize these costs and control errors. We validate the algorithm using a Ginzburg-Landau test problem and demonstrate its low cost and improved scaling using a three-dimensional discretization of a turbulent jet. Lastly, we use it to study the impact of low-speed streaks on the development of Kelvin-Helmholtz wavepackets in the jet via secondary stability analysis, a problem that would have been intractable using previous algorithms.},

This approach is a valuable tool for exploring and discovering response regimes in complex dynamical systems, especially when the governing equations and the number of response regimes are unknown, and the system is expensive to sample. Additionally, the method is useful for order reduction, as it can be used to identify the most dominant response regimes of a given dynamical system. DR\$\^2\$EI utilizes unsupervised learning algorithms to transform the system's response into an embedding space that facilitates regime classification. An active sequential sampling approach based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is used to efficiently sample the parameter space, quantify uncertainty, and provide optimal trade-offs between exploration and exploitation. The performance of the DR\$\^2\$EI method was evaluated by analyzing three established dynamical systems: the mathematical pendulum, the Lorenz system, and the Duffing oscillator. The method was shown to effectively identify a variety of response regimes with both similar and distinct topological features and frequency content, demonstrating its versatility in capturing a wide range of behaviors. While it may not be possible to guarantee that all possible regimes will be identified, the method provides an automated and efficient means for exploring the parameter space of a dynamical system and identifying its underlying "sufficiently dominant" response regimes without prior knowledge of the system's equations or behavior.},

Repeated Greedy achieves \$(1 + O(1/{\textbackslash}sqrt\{k\}))k\$ approximation using \$O(nr{\textbackslash}sqrt\{k\})\$ function evaluations (here, \$n\$ and \$r\$ denote the size of the ground set and the maximum size of a feasible solution, respectively).

Sample Greedy achieves \$(k + 3)\$-approximation with only \$O(nr/k)\$ function evaluations. Finally, we derive an almost matching lower bound, and show that no polynomial time algorithm can have an approximation ratio smaller than \$ k + 1/2 - {\textbackslash}varepsilon\$.

First, we propose a constrained Galerkin formulation that corrects the standard Galerkin statement by incorporating prior information about the long-time attractor. For explicit and semi-implicit time discretizations, our statement reads as a constrained quadratic programming problem where the objective function is the Euclidean norm of the error in the reduced Galerkin (algebraic) formulation, while the constraints correspond to bounds for the maximum and minimum value of the coefficients of the N-term expansion. Second, we propose an a posteriori error indicator, which corresponds to the dual norm of the residual associated with the time-averaged momentum equation. We demonstrate that the error indicator is highly-correlated with the error in mean flow prediction, and can be efficiently computed through an offline/online strategy. Third, we propose a Greedy algorithm for the construction of an approximation space/procedure valid over a range of parameters; the Greedy is informed by the a posteriori error indicator developed in this paper. We illustrate our approach and we demonstrate its effectiveness by studying the dependence of a two-dimensional turbulent lid-driven cavity flow on the Reynolds number.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel learning framework to construct Koopman eigenfunctions for unknown, nonlinear dynamics using data gathered from experiments. The learning framework can extract spectral information from the full nonlinear dynamics by learning the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the associated Koopman operator. We then exploit the learned Koopman eigenfunctions to learn a lifted linear statespace model. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to utilize Koopman eigenfunctions as lifting functions for EDMD-based methods. We demonstrate the performance of the framework in state prediction and closed loop trajectory tracking of a simulated cart pole system. Our method is able to significantly improve the controller performance while relying on linear control methods to do nonlinear control.},

  abstract = {The theory of transient growth describes how linear mechanisms can cause temporary amplification of disturbances even when the linearized system is asymptotically stable as defined by its eigenvalues. This growth is traditionally quantified by finding the initial disturbance that generates the maximum response, in terms of energy gain, at the peak time of its evolution. While this bounds the growth, it can vastly overstate the growth of a real disturbance. In this paper, we introduce a statistical perspective on transient growth that models statistics of the energy amplification of the disturbances. We derive a formula for the mean energy amplification in terms of the two-point spatial correlation of the initial disturbance. We also derive an accurate approximation of the probability density function of the energy of the growing disturbance, from which confidence bounds on the growth can be obtained. Applying our analysis to Poisseuille flow yields a number of observations. First, the mean gain can be drastically smaller than the maximum, especially when the disturbances are broadband in wavenumber content. In these cases, it is exceedingly unlikely to achieve near-optimal growth due to the exponential behavior which we observe in the probability density function. Second, the characteristic length scale of the initial disturbances has a significant impact on the expected growth; specifically, large-scale initial disturbances produce orders-of-magnitude-larger expected growth than smaller scales, indicating that the length scale of incoming disturbances may be key in determining whether transient growth leads to transition for a particular flow. Finally, while the optimal growth scales quadratically with Reynolds number, we observe that the mean energy amplification scales only linearly for certain reasonable choices of the initial correlations.},

  abstract = {Time-delay embedding is an increasingly popular starting point for data-driven reduced-order modeling efforts. In particular, the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a block Hankel matrix formed from successive delay embeddings of the state of a dynamical system lies at the heart of several popular reduced-order modeling methods. In this paper, we show that the left singular vectors of this Hankel matrix are a discrete approximation of classical space-time proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) modes, and the singular values are square roots of the POD energies. This connection establishes a clear interpretation of the Hankel modes grounded in classical theory, and we gain insights into the Hankel modes by instead analyzing the equivalent discrete space-time POD modes in terms of the correlation matrix formed by multiplying the Hankel matrix by its conjugate transpose. These insights include the distinct meaning of rows and columns, the implied norm in which the modes are optimal, the impact of the time step between snapshots on the modes, and an interpretation of the embedding dimension/height of the Hankel matrix in terms of the time window on which the modes are optimal. Moreover, the connections we establish offer opportunities to improve the convergence and computation time in certain practical cases, and to improve the accuracy of the modes with the same data. Finally, popular variants of POD, namely the standard space-only POD and spectral POD, are recovered in the limits that snapshots used to form each column of the Hankel matrix represent flow evolution over short and long times, respectively.},

For non-divergent fluid-like flows, we demonstrate that eigenvectors of numerical transfer operators efficiently decompose the domain into invariant regions. For dissipative chaotic flows such a decomposition into invariant regions does not exist; instead, the transfer operator approach detects almost-invariant sets. We demonstrate numerically that the boundaries of these almost-invariant regions are predominantly comprised of segments of co-dimension 1 invariant manifolds. For a mixing periodically driven fluid-like flow we show that while sets bounded by stable and unstable manifolds are almost-invariant, the transfer operator approach can identify almost-invariant sets with smaller mass leakage. Thus the transport mechanism of lobe dynamics need not correspond to minimal transport. The transfer operator approach is purely probabilistic; it directly determines those regions that minimally mix with their surroundings. The almost-invariant regions are identified via eigenvectors of a transfer operator and are ranked by the corresponding eigenvalues in the order of the sets' invariance or ``leakiness''. While we demonstrate that the almost-invariant sets are often bounded by segments of invariant manifolds, without such a ranking it is not at all clear which intersections of invariant manifolds form the major barriers to mixing. Furthermore, in some cases invariant manifolds do not bound sets of minimal leakage. Our transfer operator constructions are very simple and fast to implement; they require a sample of short trajectories, followed by eigenvector calculations of a sparse matrix.},

We use this connection to propose a data-driven algorithm for feedback linearization. Particularly, we use experimental data to identify the state transformation and control feedback from a dictionary of functions for which feedback linearization is achieved in a least-squares sense.

In the former, we analyze least squares approaches for Markov parameter estimation, and in the latter, we analyze the multiple shooting approach. We demonstrate the limitations of the optimization problems posed by these existing methods by showing that they can be seen as special cases of the proposed optimization objective under certain simplifying assumptions: conditional independence of data and zero model error. Furthermore, we observe that our proposed approach has improved smoothness and inherent regularization that make it well-suited for system ID and provide mathematical explanations for these characteristics' origins. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate a mean squared error over 8.7 times lower compared to multiple shooting when data are noisy and/or sparse. Moreover, the proposed approach can identify accurate and generalizable models even when there are more parameters than data or when the underlying system exhibits chaotic behavior.},

Data required for training and test of the ANN are provided by direct numerical simulation of a turbulent channel flow. It is shown that an ANN can establish a model similar to the gradient model. The correlation coefficients between the real SGS stress and the output of the ANN are comparable to or larger than similarity models, but smaller than a two-parameter dynamic mixed model.

However, the control of false discoveries for sparse model identification is challenging, especially in the low-data and high-noise limit. In this paper, we perform a theoretical study on ensemble sparse model discovery, which shows empirical success in terms of accuracy and robustness to noise. In particular, we analyse the bootstrapping-based sequential thresholding least-squares estimator. We show that this bootstrapping-based ensembling technique can perform a provably correct variable selection procedure with an exponential convergence rate of the error rate. In addition, we show that the ensemble sparse model discovery method can perform computationally efficient uncertainty estimation, compared to expensive Bayesian uncertainty quantification methods via MCMC. We demonstrate the convergence properties and connection to uncertainty quantification in various numerical studies on synthetic sparse linear regression and sparse model discovery. The experiments on sparse linear regression support that the bootstrapping-based sequential thresholding least-squares method has better performance for sparse variable selection compared to LASSO, thresholding least-squares, and bootstrapping-based LASSO. In the sparse model discovery experiment, we show that the bootstrapping-based sequential thresholding least-squares method can provide valid uncertainty quantification, converging to a delta measure centered around the true value with increased sample sizes. Finally, we highlight the improved robustness to hyperparameter selection under shifting noise and sparsity levels of the bootstrapping-based sequential thresholding least-squares method compared to other sparse regression methods.},

Since the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is also uncertain in this context, to achieve a robust signal extraction, we propose a new placement criterion based on the maximization of the probability that the SNR exceeds a given threshold. This criterion can be easily evaluated using the Gaussian process assumption. Moreover, to reduce the computational complexity of the joint maximization of the criterion with respect to all sensor positions, we suggest a sequential maximization approach, where the sensor positions are chosen one at a time.

Modal stability analysis shows the destabilization of the flow with increasing porosity of the layer. The instability mode originates from the homogeneous fluid region of the channel for all the values of porosity considered but the governing mechanism changes. Perturbation kinetic energy analysis reveals the importance of viscous dissipation at low porosity values while dissipation in the porous substrate becomes significant at higher porosity. Scaling analysis highlights the invariance of the critical wavenumber with changing porosity. On the other hand, the critical Reynolds number remains invariant at low porosity and scales as Rec{$\sim$}(H/{$\delta$})1.4 at high porosity where {$\delta$} is the typical thickness of the vorticity layer at the fluid{\textendash}porous interface. This reveals the existence of a Tollmien{\textendash}Schlichting-like viscous instability mechanism at low porosity values, and Rayleigh analysis shows the presence of an inviscid instability mechanism at high porosity. For the whole range of porosities considered, the non-modal analysis shows that the optimal mechanism responsible for transient energy amplification is the lift-up effect, giving rise to streaky structure as in single-phase plane Poiseuille flow. The present results strongly suggest that the transition to turbulence follows the same path as that of classical Poiseuille flow at low porosity values, while it is dictated by the modal instability for high porosity values.},

  abstract = {Non-intrusive model reduction is a promising solution to system dynamics prediction, especially in cases where data are collected from experimental campaigns or proprietary software simulations. In this work, we present a method for non-intrusive model reduction applied to Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) problems. The approach is based on the a priori known sparsity of the full-order system operators, which is dictated by grid adjacency information. In order to enforce this type of sparsity, we solve a local, regularized least-squares problem for each degree of freedom on a grid, considering only the training data from adjacent degrees of freedom, thus making computation and storage of the inferred full-order operators feasible. After constructing the non-intrusive, sparse full-order model, Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) is used for its projection to a reduced dimension subspace and thus the construction of a reduced-order model (ROM). The methodology is applied to the challenging Hron-Turek benchmark FSI3, for Re = 200. A physics-informed, non-intrusive ROM is constructed to predict the two-way coupled dynamics of a solid with a deformable, slender tail, subject to an incompressible, laminar flow. Results considering the accuracy and predictive capabilities of the inferred reduced models are discussed.},

  abstract = {No free lunch theorems for supervised learning state that no learner can solve all problems or that all learners achieve exactly the same accuracy on average over a uniform distribution on learning problems. Accordingly, these theorems are often referenced in support of the notion that individual problems require specially tailored inductive biases. While virtually all uniformly sampled datasets have high complexity, real-world problems disproportionately generate low-complexity data, and we argue that neural network models share this same preference, formalized using Kolmogorov complexity. Notably, we show that architectures designed for a particular domain, such as computer vision, can compress datasets on a variety of seemingly unrelated domains. Our experiments show that pre-trained and even randomly initialized language models prefer to generate low-complexity sequences. Whereas no free lunch theorems seemingly indicate that individual problems require specialized learners, we explain how tasks that often require human intervention such as picking an appropriately sized model when labeled data is scarce or plentiful can be automated into a single learning algorithm. These observations justify the trend in deep learning of unifying seemingly disparate problems with an increasingly small set of machine learning models.},

The PBDW algorithm is a state estimation method involving reduced models. It aims at approximating an unknown function \$u\^\{{\textbackslash}rm true\}\$ living in a high-dimensional Hilbert space from \$M\$ measurement observations given in the form \$y\_m = {\textbackslash}ell\_m(u\^\{{\textbackslash}rm true\}),{\textbackslash}, m=1,{\textbackslash}dots,M\$, where \${\textbackslash}ell\_m\$ are linear functionals. The method approximates \$u\^\{{\textbackslash}rm true\}\$ with \${\textbackslash}hat\{u\} = {\textbackslash}hat\{z\} + {\textbackslash}hat\{{\textbackslash}eta\}\$. The {\textbackslash}emph\{background\} \${\textbackslash}hat\{z\}\$ belongs to an \$N\$-dimensional linear space \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{Z\}\_N\$ built from reduced modelling of a parameterized mathematical model, and the {\textbackslash}emph\{update\} \${\textbackslash}hat\{{\textbackslash}eta\}\$ belongs to the space \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{U\}\_M\$ spanned by the Riesz representers of \$({\textbackslash}ell\_1,{\textbackslash}dots, {\textbackslash}ell\_M)\$. When the measurements are noisy \{--- i.e., \$y\_m = {\textbackslash}ell\_m(u\^\{{\textbackslash}rm true\})+{\textbackslash}epsilon\_m\$ with \${\textbackslash}epsilon\_m\$ being a noise term --- \} the classical PBDW formulation is not robust in the sense that, if \$N\$ increases, the reconstruction accuracy degrades. In this paper, we propose to address this issue with an extension of the classical formulation, \{which consists in\} searching for the background \${\textbackslash}hat\{z\}\$ either on the whole \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{Z\}\_N\$ in the noise-free case, or on a well-chosen subset \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{K\}\_N {\textbackslash}subset {\textbackslash}mathcal\{Z\}\_N\$ in presence of noise. The restriction to \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{K\}\_N\$ makes the reconstruction be nonlinear and is the key to make the algorithm significantly more robust against noise. We \{further\} present an {\textbackslash}emph\{a priori\} error and stability analysis, and we illustrate the efficiency of the approach on several numerical examples.},

It plays an essential role in an engineering design cycle and digital twinning. In this work, we primarily focus on an operator inference methodology that builds dynamical models, preferably in low-dimension, with a prior hypothesis on the model structure, often determined by known physics or given by experts. Then, for inference, we aim to learn the operators of a model by setting up an appropriate optimization problem. One of the critical properties of dynamical systems is\{stability. However, such a property is not guaranteed by the inferred models. In this work, we propose inference formulations to learn quadratic models, which are stable by design. Precisely, we discuss the parameterization of quadratic systems that are locally and globally stable. Moreover, for quadratic systems with no stable point yet bounded (e.g., Chaotic Lorenz model), we discuss an attractive trapping region philosophy and a parameterization of such systems. Using those parameterizations, we set up inference problems, which are then solved using a gradient-based optimization method. Furthermore, to avoid numerical derivatives and still learn continuous systems, we make use of an integration form of differential equations. We present several numerical examples, illustrating the preservation of stability and discussing its comparison with the existing state-of-the-art approach to infer operators. By means of numerical examples, we also demonstrate how proposed methods are employed to discover governing equations and energy-preserving models.\vphantom\}},

This paper presents a sensor-selection framework for the intended application of data-driven, flow-field estimation. This framework combines data-driven modeling, steady-state Kalman Filter design, and a sparsification technique for sequential selection of sensors. This paper also uses the sensor selection framework to design sensor arrays that can perform well across a variety of operating conditions. Flow estimation results on numerical data show that the proposed framework produces arrays that are highly effective at flow-field estimation for the flow behind and an airfoil at a high angle of attack using embedded pressure sensors. Analysis of the flow fields reveals that paths of impinging stagnation points along the airfoil's surface during a shedding period of the flow are highly informative locations for placement of pressure sensors.},

The resulting low-order models were found to predict the flows in four open-loop test cases with sufficient fidelity to justify their application in model-based control of the vortex-shedding flow. In Part II, optimal control theory is used to implement the model-based control, and data from numerical simulations of the controlled flow are presented. It is found that the level of wake unsteadiness can be reduced, even when the low-order model is reset on the basis of limited flow field information. The degree of reduction is dependent on the accuracy of the low-order model, and ways of refining it in the light of control simulations are considered.

In the present study, two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) wake transitions of a NACA0012 airfoil are studied for angles of attack in the range 0{$\circ\leq\mathsl{A}\leq$}20{$\circ$}0{$\circ\leq\alpha\leq$}20{$\circ$}0\^{\textbackslash}circ {\textbackslash}leq {\textbackslash}alpha {\textbackslash}leq 20\^{\textbackslash}circ and Reynolds numbers 500{$\leq$}Re{$\leq$}5000500{$\leq$}Re{$\leq$}5000500 {\textbackslash}leq \{{\textbackslash}textit \{Re\}\} {\textbackslash}leq 5000. The study uses water-channel experiments and 2-D and 3-D numerical simulations based on the nodal spectral-element method, level-set function-based immersed-interface method and Floquet stability analysis. The different wake states are categorised based on the time-instantaneous wake structure, non-dimensional frequency and aerodynamic force coefficients. The wake states and transition boundaries are summarised in a wake regime map. The critical angle of attack and Reynolds number for the supercritical Hopf bifurcation (i.e. steady to periodic wake transition) varies as {$\mathsl{A}$}1{$\sim$}Re-0.65{$\alpha$}1{$\sim$}Re-0.65{\textbackslash}alpha \_1 \{{\textbackslash}sim\} \{{\textbackslash}textit \{Re\}\}\^\{-0.65\}, while the critical angle of attack for the onset of three dimensionality varies as {$\mathsl{A}$}3{$\mathsl{D}\sim$}Re-0.5{$\alpha$}3D{$\sim$}Re-0.5{\textbackslash}alpha \_\{3D\} \{{\textbackslash}sim\} \{{\textbackslash}textit \{Re\}\}\^\{-0.5\}. Over the entire Reynolds number range, the transition to 3-D flow occurs through a mode C (subharmonic) transition. Beyond this initial transition, further instabilities of the 2-D periodic base flow arise and are investigated. For instance, at Re=2000Re=2000 \{{\textbackslash}textit \{Re\}\}=2000 and {$\mathsl{A}$}3{$\mathsl{D}$},2=11.0{$\circ\alpha$}3D,2=11.0{$\circ\backslash$}alpha \_\{3D,2\}=11.0\^{\textbackslash}circ, mode C coexists together with modes related to modes A and QP seen in a stationary circular cylinder wake. In contrast, at Re=5000Re=5000 \{{\textbackslash}textit \{Re\}\}=5000 and {$\mathsl{A}$}3{$\mathsl{D}$},2=8.0{$\circ\alpha$}3D,2=8.0{$\circ\backslash$}alpha \_\{3D,2\}=8.0\^{\textbackslash}circ, the dominant mode C coexists with mode QP. Three-dimensional simulations well beyond critical angles indicate that 2-D vortex-street transitions are approximately maintained in the fully saturated 3-D wakes in a spanwise-averaged sense.},

This generalizes DMD to a larger class of datasets, including nonsequential time series. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by presenting novel sampling strategies that increase computational efficiency and mitigate the effects of noise, respectively. We also introduce the concept of linear consistency, which helps explain the potential pitfalls of applying DMD to rank-deficient datasets, illustrating with examples. Such computations are not considered in the existing literature but can be understood using our more general framework. In addition, we show that our theory strengthens the connections between DMD and Koopman operator theory. It also establishes connections between DMD and other techniques, including the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA), a system identification method, and linear inverse modeling (LIM), a method from climate science. We show that under certain conditions, DMD is equivalent to LIM.},

These appealing properties of SBC make it the optimal criterion for choosing lag length in many situations, especially in the case of financial data, which are usually characterized by occasional periods of high volatility. SBC also has the best forecasting abilities in the majority of situations in which we vary sample size, stability, variance structure (ARCH or not), and forecast horizon (one period or five). frequently, AICC also has good lag-choosing and forecasting properties. However, when ARCH is present, the five-period forecast performance of all criteria in all situations worsens.},

It is shown that under certain conditions these acceleration procedures are equivalent to similar procedures applied to the "double method" corresponding to two applications of the original basic iterative method. This result is applied to show the equivalence of certain acceleration procedures applied to the Jacobi methods for "red/black" systems, and similar procedures applied to the "reduced system," which is obtained from the original system by eliminating some of the unknowns. The result is also used to study the behavior of the generalized conjugate gradient procedure of Concus and Golub and of Widlund, for solving linear systems where the matrices are positive real rather than symmetric and positive definite.}

  abstract = {The simulation of atmospheric flows by means of traditional discretization methods remains computationally intensive, hindering the achievement of high forecasting accuracy in short time frames. In this paper, we apply three reduced order models that have successfully reduced the computational time for different applications in computational fluid dynamics while preserving accuracy: Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), Hankel Dynamic Mode Decomposition (HDMD), and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition with Interpolation (PODI). The three methods are compared in terms of computational time and accuracy in the simulation of two well-known benchmarks for mesoscale flow. The accuracy of the DMD and HDMD solutions deteriorates rather quickly as the forecast time window expands, although these methods are designed to predict the dynamics of a system. The reason is likely the strong nonlinearity in the benchmark flows. The PODI solution is accurate for the entire duration of the time interval of interest thanks to the use of interpolation with radial basis functions. This holds true also when the model features a physical parameter expected to vary in a given range, as is typically the case in weather prediction.},

In this setting, a nonlinear normal mode (NNM) is a set filled with small-amplitude recurrent motions: a fixed point, a periodic orbit or the closure of a quasiperiodic orbit. In contrast, a spectral submanifold (SSM) is an invariant manifold asymptotic to a NNM, serving as the smoothest nonlinear continuation of a spectral subspace of the linearized system along the NNM. The existence and uniqueness of SSMs turns out to depend on a spectral quotient computed from the real part of the spectrum of the linearized system. This quotient may well be large even for small dissipation; thus, the inclusion of damping is essential for firm conclusions about NNMs, SSMs and the reduced-order models they yield.},

  abstract = {The challenges of understanding the impacts of air pollution require detailed information on the state of air quality. While many modeling approaches attempt to treat this problem, physically-based deterministic methods are often overlooked due to their costly computational requirements and complicated implementation. In this work we extend a non-intrusive Reduced Basis Data Assimilation method (known as PBDW state estimation) to large pollutant dispersion case studies relying on equations involved in chemical transport models for air quality modeling. This, with the goal of rendering methods based on parameterized partial differential equations (PDE) feasible in air quality modeling applications requiring quasi-real-time approximation and correction of model error in imperfect models. Reduced basis methods (RBM) aim to compute a cheap and accurate approximation of a physical state using approximation spaces made of a suitable sample of solutions to the model. One of the keys of these techniques is the decomposition of the computational work into an expensive one-time offline stage and a low-cost parameter-dependent online stage. Traditional RBMs require modifying the assembly routines of the computational code, an intrusive procedure which may be impossible in cases of operational model codes. We propose a less intrusive reduced order method using data assimilation for measured pollution concentrations, adapted for consideration of the scale and specific application to exterior pollutant dispersion as can be found in urban air quality studies. Common statistical techniques of data assimilation in use in these applications require large historical data sets, or time-consuming iterative methods. The method proposed here avoids both disadvantages. In the case studies presented in this work, the method allows to correct for unmodeled physics and treat cases of unknown parameter values, all while significantly reducing online computational time.},

In the usual offline setting, we present SampleGreedy, which obtains a \$(p + 2 + o(1))\$-approximation for maximizing a submodular function subject to a \$p\$-extendible system using \$O(n + nk/p)\$ evaluation and feasibility queries, where \$k\$ is the size of the largest feasible set.

Given a dictionary of functions, these methods approximate the projection of the action of the operator on the finite-dimensional subspace spanned by the dictionary. We propose the Tunable Symmetric Subspace Decomposition algorithm to refine the dictionary, balancing its expressiveness and accuracy. Expressiveness corresponds to the ability of the dictionary to describe the evolution of as many observables as possible and accuracy corresponds to the ability to correctly predict their evolution. Based on the observation that Koopman-invariant subspaces give rise to exact predictions, we reason that prediction accuracy is a function of the degree of invariance of the subspace generated by the dictionary and provide a data-driven measure to measure invariance proximity. The proposed algorithm iteratively prunes the initial function space to identify a refined dictionary of functions that satisfies the desired level of accuracy while retaining as much of the original expressiveness as possible. We provide a full characterization of the algorithm properties and show that it generalizes both Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition and Symmetric Subspace Decomposition. Simulations on multiple systems show the effectiveness of the proposed methods in producing Koopman approximations of tunable accuracy that capture relevant information about the dynamical system.},

This lag-choosing procedure has been suggested by Hatemi-J (1999). The results based on the Monte Carlo simulations show that combining the LR test with SBC and HQC causes a substantial increase in the success rate of choosing the optimal lag order compared to cases when only SBC or HQC are used. This appears to be the case irrespective of homoscedasticity or conditional heteroscedasticity properties of the error-term in small sample sizes.

This method reduced gust impact by 84\%, directly from real-time, on-board pressure signals. Notably, we found that gust alleviation using signals from only three pressure taps was statistically indistinguishable from using six signals.

A serious limitation of this method, however, is that it is empirical. In other words, this basis accurately represents the flow data used to generate it, but may not be accurate when applied `off-design'. Thus, the reduced-order model may lose accuracy for flow parameters (e.g. Reynolds number, initial or boundary conditions and forcing parameters) different from those used to generate the POD basis and generally does. This paper investigates the use of sensitivity analysis in the basis selection step to partially address this limitation. We examine two strategies that use the sensitivity of the POD modes with respect to the problem parameters. Numerical experiments performed on the flow past a square cylinder over a range of Reynolds numbers demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies. The newly derived bases allow for a more accurate representation of the flows when exploring the parameter space. Expanding the POD basis built at one state with its sensitivity leads to low-dimensional dynamical systems having attractors that approximate fairly well the attractor of the full-order Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations for large parameter changes.},

The primary distinction between online nonstochastic control and other frameworks is the objective. In optimal control, robust control, and other control methodologies that assume stochastic noise, the goal is to perform comparably to an offline optimal strategy. In online nonstochastic control, both the cost functions as well as the perturbations from the assumed dynamical model are chosen by an adversary. Thus the optimal policy is not defined a priori. Rather, the target is to attain low regret against the best policy in hindsight from a benchmark class of policies. This objective suggests the use of the decision making framework of online convex optimization as an algorithmic methodology. The resulting methods are based on iterative mathematical optimization algorithms, and are accompanied by finite-time regret and computational complexity guarantees.},

  abstract = {The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD){\textemdash}a popular method for performing data-driven Koopman spectral analysis{\textemdash}has gained increased popularity for extracting dynamically meaningful spatiotemporal descriptions of fluid flows from snapshot measurements. Often times, DMD descriptions can be used for predictive purposes as well, which enables informed decision-making based on DMD model forecasts. Despite its widespread use and utility, DMD can fail to yield accurate dynamical descriptions when the measured snapshot data are imprecise due to, e.g., sensor noise. Here, we express DMD as a two-stage algorithm in order to isolate a source of systematic error. We show that DMD's first stage, a subspace projection step, systematically introduces bias errors by processing snapshots asymmetrically. To remove this systematic error, we propose utilizing an augmented snapshot matrix in a subspace projection step, as in problems of total leastsquares, in order to account for the error present in all snapshots. The resulting unbiased and noise-aware total DMD (TDMD) formulation reduces to standard DMD in the absence of snapshot errors, while the two-stage perspective generalizes the de-biasing framework to other related methods as well. TDMD's performance is demonstrated in numerical and experimental fluids examples. In particular, in the analysis of time-resolved particle image velocimetry data for a separated flow, TDMD outperforms standard DMD by providing dynamical interpretations that are consistent with alternative analysis techniques. Further, TDMD extracts modes that reveal detailed spatial structures missed by standard DMD.},

However, whereas resolvent modes have demonstrated great potential to guide sensor and actuator placement, observability and controllability modes have been leveraged exclusively in the context of model reduction via input and output projections. In this work, we introduce interpolatory, rather than orthogonal, input and output projections, that can be leveraged for sensor and actuator placement and open-loop control design. An interpolatory projector is an oblique projector with the property of preserving certain entries in the vector being projected. We review the connection between the resolvent operator and the Gramians, and present several numerical examples where we perform both orthogonal and interpolatory input and output projections onto the dominant forcing and response subspaces. Input projections are used to identify dynamically relevant disturbances, place sensors to measure disturbances, and place actuators for feedforward control in the linearized Ginzburg{\textendash}Landau equation. Output projections are used to identify coherent structures and place sensors aiming at state reconstruction in the turbulent flow in a minimal channel at {$\mathsl{R}\mathsl{e}\mathsl{T}$}=185Re{$\tau$}=185Re\_\{{\textbackslash}tau \}=185. The framework does not require data snapshots and relies only on knowledge of the steady or mean flow.},

In this approach to turbulence decomposition, which has recently been termed Spectral POD (SPOD), Fourier modes are considered as solutions to the corresponding Fredholm integral equation of the second kind along homogeneous-periodic or homogeneous coordinates. In the present work, the notion that the POD modes formally converge to Fourier modes for increasing domain length is challenged. Numerical results indicate that the discrepancy between POD and Fourier modes along {\textbackslash}textit\{locally\} translationally invariant coordinates is coupled to the Taylor macro/micro scale ratio (MMSR) of the kernel in question. Increasing discrepancies are observed for smaller MMSRs, which are characteristic of low Reynolds number flows. It is observed that the asymptotic convergence rate of the eigenspectrum matches the corresponding convergence rate of the exact analytical Fourier spectrum of the kernel in question - even for extremely small domains and small MMSRs where the corresponding DFT spectra suffer heavily from windowing effects. These results indicate that the accumulated discrepancies between POD and Fourier modes play a role in producing the spectral convergence rates expected from Fourier transforms of translationally invariant kernels on infinite domains.},

Deeptime is a general purpose Python library offering various tools to estimate dynamical models based on time-series data including conventional linear learning methods, such as Markov state models (MSMs), Hidden Markov Models and Koopman models, as well as kernel and deep learning approaches such as VAMPnets and deep MSMs. The library is largely compatible with scikit-learn, having a range of Estimator classes for these different models, but in contrast to scikit-learn also provides deep Model classes, e.g. in the case of an MSM, which provide a multitude of analysis methods to compute interesting thermodynamic, kinetic and dynamical quantities, such as free energies, relaxation times and transition paths. The library is designed for ease of use but also easily maintainable and extensible code. In this paper we introduce the main features and structure of the deeptime software.

However, high dimensional and nonlinear nature of fluid flows poses challenges in designing efficient control laws. This paper aims to propose a hybrid method (i.e., machine learning and control theory) for feedback control of fluid flows. We propose a partially nonlinear linear-system extraction autoencoder (pn-LEAE), which consists of convolutional neural networks-based autoencoder (CNN-AE) and a custom layer to extract a low-dimensional latent dynamics. This pn-LEAE basically extracts a linear dynamical system so that the modern control theory can easily be applied, but at the same time, it is designed to capture a nonlinear development of the latent dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the linear system extracted by the pn-LEAE, as well as the designed control law's effectiveness for a flow around a circular cylinder at the Reynolds number of \$\{{\textbackslash}rm Re\}\_\{D\}=100\$. This is the first attempt utilizing CNN-AE for linearization of fluid flows involving transient development to design a feedback control law.},

These problems are often posed as minimizing the difference between submodular functions [9, 23] which is in the worst case inapproximable. We show, however, that by phrasing these problems as constrained optimization, which is more natural for many applications, we achieve a number of bounded approximation guarantees. We also show that both these problems are closely related and, an approximation algorithm solving one can be used to obtain an approximation guarantee for the other. We provide hardness results for both problems thus showing that our approximation factors are tight up to log-factors.

As an energy constraint, only a subset of sensors can take a measurement at each time step. These measurements are fused into a common state estimate using a Kalman filter and the goal is to schedule the sensors to minimize the estimation error at a terminal time. A simple approach is to greedily choose sensors at each time step to minimize the estimation error at the next time step. Recent work has shown that this greedy algorithm outperforms other well known approaches. Results have been established to show that the estimation error is a submodular function of the sensor schedule; submodular functions have a diminishing returns property that ensures the greedy algorithm yields near optimal performance. As a negative result, we show that most commonly-used estimation error metrics are not, in general, submodular functions. This disproves an established result. We then provide sufficient conditions on the system for which the estimation error is a submodular function of the sensor schedule, and thus the greedy algorithm yields performance guarantees.},

Recent work has indicated that the simple greedy algorithm, which chooses the sensor at each time step that maximizes the error covariance reduction, outperforms many other known scheduling algorithms.

In practical applications, the observable function is required to have an invertible property to predict or control the original system. However, two approaches for constructing the invertible observable functions in current research, introducing the full-state observables and adopting the auto-encoder, have drawbacks such as overly strong assumptions and lossy reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose the Invertible Koopman Network (IKN) to approximate the Koopman operator. With special invertible blocks, IKN achieves structure-level reversibility while retaining sufficient nonlinear mapping capability. This network results in a transformation from the complex dynamic system's states to the observables with simpler dynamics and affords lossless reconstruction via its invertible process. Then, we use the IKN as a dynamical embedding model and adopt the Transformer based on an autoregressive task to learn the evolution pattern of the observables. Through the greedy decoding strategy, the trained IKN and Transformer model enable data-driven prediction where only initial value is provided. The method is tested on three typical chaotic dynamic systems (Lorenz system, Chen system, and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation) and is shown to capture the systems' intrinsic evolution patterns, such as the structure of the strange attractor. Comparative experiments with alternative data-driven modeling approaches illustrate that our proposed method can model a longer evolutionary process with less error, further demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority.},

The second is to change the Koopman model and an adaptive controller's parameters in tandem to ensure asymptotic stability of the origin of the closed-loop system. This may mean that the Koopman model itself is less accurate, however, the controlled system is guaranteed to be stable.

The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm is one approach to discover dynamical systems models from data. Although extensions have been developed to identify implicit dynamics, or dynamics described by rational functions, these extensions are extremely sensitive to noise. In this work, we develop SINDy-PI (parallel, implicit), a robust variant of the SINDy algorithm to identify implicit dynamics and rational nonlinearities. The SINDy-PI framework includes multiple optimization algorithms and a principled approach to model selection. We demonstrate the ability of this algorithm to learn implicit ordinary and partial differential equations and conservation laws from limited and noisy data. In particular, we show that the proposed approach is several orders of magnitude more noise robust than previous approaches, and may be used to identify a class of ODE and PDE dynamics that were previously unattainable with SINDy, including for the double pendulum dynamics and simplified model for the Belousov{\textendash}Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction.},

  abstract = {Data-driven transformations that reformulate nonlinear systems in a linear framework have the potential to enable the prediction, estimation, and control of strongly nonlinear dynamics using linear systems theory. The Koopman operator has emerged as a principled linear embedding of nonlinear dynamics, and its eigenfunctions establish intrinsic coordinates along which the dynamics behave linearly. Previous studies have used finite-dimensional approximations of the Koopman operator for model-predictive control approaches. In this work, we illustrate a fundamental closure issue of this approach and argue that it is beneficial to first validate eigenfunctions and then construct reduced-order models in these validated eigenfunctions. These coordinates form a Koopman-invariant subspace by design and, thus, have improved predictive power. We show then how the control can be formulated directly in these intrinsic coordinates and discuss potential benefits and caveats of this perspective. The resulting control architecture is termed Koopman Reduced Order Nonlinear Identification and Control (KRONIC). It is demonstrated that these eigenfunctions can be approximated with data-driven regression and power series expansions, based on the partial differential equation governing the infinitesimal generator of the Koopman operator. Validating discovered eigenfunctions is crucial and we show that lightly damped eigenfunctions may be faithfully extracted from EDMD or an implicit formulation. These lightly damped eigenfunctions are particularly relevant for control, as they correspond to nearly conserved quantities that are associated with persistent dynamics, such as the Hamiltonian. KRONIC is then demonstrated on a number of relevant examples, including 1) a nonlinear system with a known linear embedding, 2) a variety of Hamiltonian systems, and 3) a high-dimensional double-gyre model for ocean mixing.},

In this work, we introduce a deep learning technique to discover a single low-dimensional model for such data that captures the underlying parametric dependence in terms of a normal form. A normal form is a symbolic expression, or universal unfolding, that describes how a the reduced-order differential equation model varies with respect to a bifurcation parameter. Our approach introduces coupled autoencoders for the state and parameter, with the latent variables constrained to adhere to a given normal form. We demonstrate our method on one-parameter bifurcations that occur in the canonical Lorenz96 equations and a neural field equation.

  abstract = {Complex systems manifest a small number of instabilities and bifurcations that are canonical in nature, resulting in universal pattern forming characteristics as a function of some parametric dependence. Such parametric instabilities are mathematically characterized by their universal un-foldings, or normal form dynamics, whereby a parsimonious model can be used to represent the dynamics. Although center manifold theory guarantees the existence of such low-dimensional normal forms, finding them has remained a long standing challenge. In this work, we introduce deep learning autoencoders to discover coordinate transformations that capture the underlying parametric dependence of a dynamical system in terms of its canonical normal form, allowing for a simple representation of the parametric dependence and bifurcation structure. The autoencoder constrains the latent variable to adhere to a given normal form, thus allowing it to learn the appropriate coordinate transformation. We demonstrate the method on a number of example problems, showing that it can capture a diverse set of normal forms associated with Hopf, pitchfork, transcritical and/or saddle node bifurcations. This method shows how normal forms can be leveraged as canonical and universal building blocks in deep learning approaches for model discovery and reduced-order modeling.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear dynamical systems are ubiquitous in science and engineering, yet analysis and prediction of these systems remains a challenge. Koopman operator theory circumvents some of these issues by considering the dynamics in the space of observable functions on the state, in which the dynamics are intrinsically linear and thus amenable to standard techniques from numerical analysis and linear algebra. However, practical issues remain with this approach, as the space of observables is infinite dimensional and selecting a subspace of functions in which to accurately represent the system is a nontrivial task. In this work we consider time-delay observables to represent nonlinear dynamics in the Koopman operator framework. We prove the surprising result that Koopman operators for different systems admit universal (system-independent) representations in these coordinates, and give analytic expressions for these representations. In addition, we show that for certain systems a restricted class of these observables form an optimal finite-dimensional basis for representing the Koopman operator, and that the analytic representation of the Koopman operator in these coordinates coincides with results computed by the dynamic mode decomposition. We provide numerical examples to complement our results. In addition to being theoretically interesting, these results have implications for a number of linearization algorithms for dynamical systems.},

At the heart of this method are optimization schemes that enforce interpolation of the symmetric generalized frequency response functions (GFRFs) as derived in the Volterra series framework. We consider harmonic input excitations to infer such measurements. After reaching the steady-state profile, the symmetric GFRFs can be measured from the Fourier spectrum (phase and amplitude). By properly using these measurements, we can identify low-order nonlinear state-space models with non-trivial equilibrium state points in the quadratic form, such as the Lorenz attractor. In particular, for the multi-point equilibrium case, where measurements describe some local bifurcated models to different coordinates, we achieve global model identification after solving an operator alignment problem based on a constrained quadratic matrix equation. We test the new method for a more demanding system in terms of state dimension, i.e., the viscous Burgers' equation with Robin boundary conditions. The complexity reduction and approximation accuracy are tested. Future directions and challenges conclude this work.},

Recent studies show that linear wavepacket models can be employed for prediction of installation noise, which suggests that linear control strategies can also be adopted for mitigation of it. We present here a simple model to test different control approaches and highlight the potential restrictions on a successful noise control in an actual jet. The model contains all the essential elements for a realistic representation of the actual control problem: a stochastic wavepacket is obtained via a linear Ginzburg-Landau model; the effect of the wing trailing edge is accounted for by introducing a semi-infinite half plane near the wavepacket; and the actuation is achieved by placing a dipolar point source at the trailing edge, which models a piezoelectric actuator. An optimal causal resolvent-based control method is compared against the classical wave-cancellation method. The effect of the causality constraint on the control performance is tested by placing the sensor at different positions. We demonstrate that when the sensor is not positioned sufficiently upstream of the trailing edge, which can be the case for the actual control problem due to geometric restrictions, causality reduces the control performance. We also show that this limitation can be moderated using the optimal causal control together with modelling of the forcing.},

We show that a low-dimensional submanifold of the edge of chaos can be constructed from velocity data using the recently developed theory of spectral submanifolds (SSMs). These manifolds are the unique smoothest nonlinear continuations of nonresonant spectral subspaces of the linearized system at stationary states.

The influence of harmonic external forcings on the wake dynamics, together with the possible synchronization of the vortex shedding behind the cylinder to these forcings, is determined by evaluating the phase response of the system to weak impulse perturbations. These horizontal and vertical perturbations are added at different phase values over a period, in order to develop a linear one-dimensional model with respect to the limit cycle that describes the high-dimensional and nonlinear dynamics of the fluid flow via only a single scalar phase variable. This model is then utilized to acquire the theoretical conditions for the synchronization between the cylinder wake and the harmonic forcings added in the global near-wake region. Valuable insights are gained by comparing the findings of the present research against those rendered by the dynamic mode decomposition and adjoint analysis of the wake dynamics in earlier works. The present analysis reveals regions in the flow which enable phase synchronization or desynchronization to periodic excitations for applications such as active flow control and fluid-structure interactions.},

We discuss the inclusion of various forms of regularization and constraints in the learning problem, such as the operator norm, the Frobenius norm, the operator rank, the nuclear norm, and the stability. Subsequently, we derive the corresponding equivalent finite-dimensional problem.

  abstract = {Predictive simulations are essential for applications ranging from weather forecasting to material design. The veracity of these simulations hinges on their capacity to capture the effective system dynamics. Massively parallel simulations predict the systems dynamics by resolving all spatiotemporal scales, often at a cost that prevents experimentation. On the other hand, reduced order models are fast but often limited by the linearization of the system dynamics and the adopted heuristic closures. We propose a novel systematic framework that bridges large scale simulations and reduced order models to extract and forecast adaptively the effective dynamics (AdaLED) of multiscale systems. AdaLED employs an autoencoder to identify reduced-order representations of the system dynamics and an ensemble of probabilistic recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as the latent time-stepper. The framework alternates between the computational solver and the surrogate, accelerating learned dynamics while leaving yet-to-be-learned dynamics regimes to the original solver. AdaLED continuously adapts the surrogate to the new dynamics through online training. The transitions between the surrogate and the computational solver are determined by monitoring the prediction accuracy and uncertainty of the surrogate. The effectiveness of AdaLED is demonstrated on three different systems - a Van der Pol oscillator, a 2D reaction-diffusion equation, and a 2D Navier-Stokes flow past a cylinder for varying Reynolds numbers (400 up to 1200), showcasing its ability to learn effective dynamics online, detect unseen dynamics regimes, and provide net speed-ups. To the best of our knowledge, AdaLED is the first framework that couples a surrogate model with a computational solver to achieve online adaptive learning of effective dynamics. It constitutes a potent tool for applications requiring many expensive simulations.},

The main advantage of conservation of kinetic energy is that it endows the hyper-reduced order model (hROM) with a nonlinear stability property. The new method poses the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) as a minimization problem and subsequently imposes constraints to conserve kinetic energy. Two methods are proposed to improve the robustness of the new method against error accumulation: oversampling and Mahalanobis regularization. Mahalanobis regularization has the benefit of not requiring additional measurement points. Furthermore, a novel method is proposed to perform structure-preserving temporal localization with the principle interval decomposition: new interface conditions are derived such that energy and momentum are conserved for a full time-integration instead of only during separate intervals. The performance of the new structure-preserving hyper-reduction methods and the structure-preserving temporal localization method is analysed using two convection-dominated test cases; a shear-layer roll-up and two-dimensional homogeneous isotropic turbulence. It is found that both Mahalanobis regularization and oversampling allow hyper-reduction of these test cases. Moreover, the Mahalanobis regularization provides comparable robustness while being more efficient than oversampling.},

  abstract = {Starting from measured data, we develop a method to compute the fine structure of the spectrum of the Koopman operator with rigorous convergence guarantees. The method is based on the observation that, in the measure-preserving ergodic setting, the moments of the spectral measure associated to a given observable are computable from a single trajectory of this observable. Having finitely many moments available, we use the classical Christoffel-Darboux kernel to separate the atomic and absolutely continuous parts of the spectrum, supported by convergence guarantees as the number of moments tends to infinity. In addition, we propose a technique to detect the singular continuous part of the spectrum as well as two methods to approximate the spectral measure with guaranteed convergence in the weak topology, irrespective of whether the singular continuous part is present or not. The proposed method is simple to implement and readily applicable to large-scale systems since the computational complexity is dominated by inverting an \$N{\textbackslash}times N\$ Hermitian positive-definite Toeplitz matrix, where \$N\$ is the number of moments, for which efficient and numerically stable algorithms exist; in particular, the complexity of the approach is independent of the dimension of the underlying state-space. We also show how to compute, from measured data, the spectral projection on a given segment of the unit circle, allowing us to obtain a finite-dimensional approximation of the operator that explicitly takes into account the point and continuous parts of the spectrum. Finally, we describe a relationship between the proposed method and the so-called Hankel Dynamic Mode Decomposition, providing new insights into the behavior of the eigenvalues of the Hankel DMD operator. A number of numerical examples illustrate the approach, including a study of the spectrum of the lid-driven two-dimensional cavity flow.},

The polynomial model form of Operator Inference is sufficiently expressive to cover a wide range of nonlinear dynamics found in fluid mechanics and other fields of science and engineering, while still providing efficient reduced model computations. The learning steps of Operator Inference are rooted in classical projection-based model reduction; thus, some of the rich theory of model reduction can be applied to models learned with Operator Inference. This connection to projection-based model reduction theory offers a pathway toward deriving error estimates and gaining insights to improve predictions. Furthermore, through formulations of Operator Inference that preserve Hamiltonian and other structures, important physical properties such as energy conservation can be guaranteed in the predictions of the reduced model beyond the training horizon. This review illustrates key computational steps of Operator Inference through a large-scale combustion example.Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics, Volume 56 is January 2024.

  abstract = {Finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs) provide a powerful approach to compute time-varying analogs of invariant manifolds in unsteady fluid flow fields. These manifolds are useful to visualize the transport mechanisms of passive tracers advecting with the flow. However, many vehicles and mobile sensors are not passive, but are instead actuated according to some intelligent trajectory planning or control law; for example, model predictive control and reinforcement learning are often used to design energy-efficient trajectories in a dynamically changing background flow. In this work, we investigate the use of FTLE on such controlled agents to gain insight into optimal transport routes for navigation in known unsteady flows. We find that these controlled FTLE (cFTLE) coherent structures separate the flow field into different regions with similar costs of transport to the goal location. These separatrices are functions of the planning algorithm's hyper-parameters, such as the optimization time horizon and the cost of actuation. Computing the invariant sets and manifolds of active agent dynamics in dynamic flow fields is useful in the context of robust motion control, hyperparameter tuning, and determining safe and collision-free trajectories for autonomous systems. Moreover, these cFTLE structures provide insight into effective deployment locations for mobile agents with actuation and energy constraints to traverse the ocean or atmosphere.},

A one-level separation allows for background (low-rank) and foreground (sparse) separation of dynamical data, or robust principal component analysis. The multi-resolution dynamic mode decomposition is capable of characterizing nonlinear dynamical systems in an equation-free manner by recursively decomposing the state of the system into low-rank terms whose temporal coefficients in time are known. DMD modes with temporal frequencies near the origin (zero-modes) are interpreted as background (low-rank) portions of the given dynamics, and the terms with temporal frequencies bounded away from the origin are their sparse counterparts. The multi-resolution dynamic mode decomposition (mrDMD) method is demonstrated on several examples involving multi-scale dynamical data, showing excellent decomposition results, including sifting the El Nin{\texttildelow}o mode from ocean temperature data. It is further applied to decompose a video data set into separate objects moving at different rates against a slowly varying background. These examples show that the decomposition is an effective dynamical systems tool for data-driven discovery.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the recently introduced multi-time-delay linear stochastic estimation technique is thoroughly described, focusing on its fundamental properties and potentialities. In the multi-time-delay approach, the estimate of the temporal evolution of the velocity at a given location in the flow field is obtained from multiple past samples of the unconditional sources. The technique is applied to estimate the velocity in a cavity shear layer flow, based on wall-pressure measurements from multiple sensors. The cavity flow was investigated by performing simultaneous measurements of a single hot-wire probe, traversed on a fine grid in the shear layer, and of multiple wall-mounted condenser microphones in the cavity region. The paper compares classical high-order single-time-delay estimation approaches with the multi-time-delay technique, which is significantly more accurate as it produces a much lower mean-square estimation error, thus providing a faithful reconstruction of the time-evolution of the velocity field. This improved accuracy is strongly dependent on the number n of past wall-pressure samples used in the estimate. In this paper, we also demonstrate that the estimated velocity field only contains the signature of the relevant flow mechanisms which correlate well with the wall-pressure, while incoherent components are filtered out. The multi-time-delay approach successfully captures the spatio-temporal dynamics of the velocity fluctuation distribution in the shear layer, as it clearly resolves the dynamics of the relevant flow structures. The effect of the number of sensors used in the estimate was also considered. In general, it was evident that use of more sensors leads to better accuracy, but as the number n of past values increases, the gain becomes marginal.}

  abstract = {Nearly all model-reduction techniques project the governing equations onto a linear subspace of the original state space. Such subspaces are typically computed using methods such as balanced truncation, rational interpolation, the reduced-basis method, and (balanced) proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). Unfortunately, restricting the state to evolve in a linear subspace imposes a fundamental limitation to the accuracy of the resulting reduced-order model (ROM). In particular, linear-subspace ROMs can be expected to produce low-dimensional models with high accuracy only if the problem admits a fast decaying Kolmogorov n-width (e.g., diffusion-dominated problems). Unfortunately, many problems of interest exhibit a slowly decaying Kolmogorov n-width (e.g., advection-dominated problems). To address this, we propose a novel framework for projecting dynamical systems onto nonlinear manifolds using minimum-residual formulations at the time-continuous and time-discrete levels; the former leads to manifold Galerkin projection, while the latter leads to manifold least-squares Petrov{\textendash}Galerkin (LSPG) projection. We perform analyses that provide insight into the relationship between these proposed approaches and classical linear-subspace reduced-order models; we also derive a posteriori discrete-time error bounds for the proposed approaches. In addition, we propose a computationally practical approach for computing the nonlinear manifold, which is based on convolutional autoencoders from deep learning. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of the method to significantly outperform even the optimal linear-subspace ROM on benchmark advection-dominated problems, thereby demonstrating the method's ability to overcome the intrinsic n-width limitations of linear subspaces.},

It may then be necessary to jointly estimate the dynamics and the latent state, making the quantification of uncertainties and the design of controllers with formal performance guarantees considerably more challenging. This paper proposes a novel method for the computation of an optimal input trajectory for unknown nonlinear systems with latent states based on a combination of particle Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and scenario theory. Probabilistic performance guarantees are derived for the resulting input trajectory, and an approach to validate the performance of arbitrary control laws is presented.

Causal Representation Learning (CRL) aims instead to infer causally related (thus often statistically dependent) latent variables, together with the unknown graph encoding their causal relationships. We introduce an intermediate problem termed Causal Component Analysis (CauCA). CauCA can be viewed as a generalization of ICA, modelling the causal dependence among the latent components, and as a special case of CRL. In contrast to CRL, it presupposes knowledge of the causal graph, focusing solely on learning the unmixing function and the causal mechanisms. Any impossibility results regarding the recovery of the ground truth in CauCA also apply for CRL, while possibility results may serve as a stepping stone for extensions to CRL. We characterize CauCA identifiability from multiple datasets generated through different types of interventions on the latent causal variables. As a corollary, this interventional perspective also leads to new identifiability results for nonlinear ICA -- a special case of CauCA with an empty graph -- requiring strictly fewer datasets than previous results. We introduce a likelihood-based approach using normalizing flows to estimate both the unmixing function and the causal mechanisms, and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive synthetic experiments in the CauCA and ICA setting.},

It enables a low-redundant adaptive extraction of coherent structures in statistically nonstationary flows, with its modes computed by solving an elaborate optimization problem using the block coordinate descent algorithm. Discussion on the intrinsic relations between RVMD and some classic modal decomposition methods demonstrates that RVMD can be reduced into proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) or discrete Fourier transform (DFT) at particular parameter settings. The significant advantages of RVMD for performing time-frequency analysis are highlighted by a signal-processing analogous categorization of the widely-used modal decomposition techniques. It is also confirmed that the combination of RVMD and the Hilbert spectral analysis provides a physically intuitive way to explore the space-time-frequency characteristics of transient dynamics.

We apply a recently developed model-free control strategy building on genetic programming in Dracopoulos and Kent (Neural Comput Appl 6:214{\textendash}228, 1997) and Gautier et al. (J Fluid Mech 770:424{\textendash}441, 2015). The optimized control laws comprise periodic forcing, multi-frequency forcing and sensor-based feedback including also time-history information feedback and combinations thereof. Key enabler is linear genetic programming (LGP) as powerful regression technique for optimizing the multiple-input multiple-output control laws. The proposed LGP control can select the best open- or closed-loop control in an unsupervised manner. Approximately 33\% base pressure recovery associated with 22\% drag reduction is achieved in all considered classes of control laws. Intriguingly, the feedback actuation emulates periodic high-frequency forcing. In addition, the control identified automatically the only sensor which listens to high-frequency flow components with good signal to noise ratio. Our control strategy is, in principle, applicable to all multiple actuators and sensors experiments.},

  abstract = {Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) plays an important role in the analysis of complex nonlinear systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), since it can describe the full-order system in a simplified but representative way using a handful of dominant dynamic modes. However, determining a POD from the results of complex unsteady simulations is often impractical using traditional approaches due to the need to store a large number of high-dimensional solutions. As an alternative, the incremental Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has been developed, which can be used to avoid the storage problem by performing the POD analysis on the fly using a single-pass updating algorithm. Nevertheless, the total computing cost of incremental SVD is more than traditional approaches. In order to reduce this total cost, we incorporate POD mode truncation into the incremental procedure, leading to an enhanced algorithm for incremental SVD. Two error estimators are formulated for this enhanced incremental SVD based on an aggregated expression of the snapshot solutions, equipping the proposed algorithm with criteria for choosing the truncation number. The effectiveness of these estimators and the parallel efficiency of the enhanced algorithm are demonstrated using transient solutions from representative model problems. Numerical results show that the enhanced algorithm can significantly improve the computing efficiency for different kinds of datasets, and that the proposed algorithm is scalable in both the strong and weak sense.},

Recently, this has been generalized to neural operators that learn mappings between function spaces. For partial differential equations (PDEs), neural operators directly learn the mapping from any functional parametric dependence to the solution. Thus, they learn an entire family of PDEs, in contrast to classical methods which solve one instance of the equation. In this work, we formulate a new neural operator by parameterizing the integral kernel directly in Fourier space, allowing for an expressive and efficient architecture. We perform experiments on Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, and Navier-Stokes equation. The Fourier neural operator is the first ML-based method to successfully model turbulent flows with zero-shot super-resolution. It is up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to traditional PDE solvers. Additionally, it achieves superior accuracy compared to previous learning-based solvers under fixed resolution.},

  abstract = {Balanced Singular Perturbation Approximation (SPA) is a model order reduction method for linear time-invariant systems that guarantees asymptotic stability and for which there exists an a priori error bound. In that respect, it is similar to Balanced Truncation (BT). However, the reduced models obtained by SPA generally introduce better approximation in the lower frequency range and near steady-states, whereas BT is better suited for the higher frequency range. Even so, independently of the frequency range of interest, BT and its variants are more often applied in practice, since there exist more efficient algorithmic realizations thereof. In this paper, we aim at closing this practically-relevant gap for SPA. We propose two novel and efficient algorithms that are adapted for different settings. Firstly, we derive a low-rank implementation of SPA that is applicable in the large-scale setting. Secondly, a data-driven reinterpretation of the method is proposed that only requires input-output data, and thus, is realization-free. A main tool for our derivations is the reciprocal transformation, which induces a distinct view on implementing the method. While the reciprocal transformation and the characterization of SPA is not new, its significance for the practical algorithmic realization has been overlooked in the literature. Our proposed algorithms have well-established counterparts for BT, and as such, also a comparable computational complexity. The numerical performance of the two novel implementations is tested for several numerical benchmarks, and comparisons to their counterparts for BT as well as the existing implementations of SPA are made.},

It is demonstrated that this neural network architecture provides improved prediction accuracy compared with a generic neural network architecture that does not embed this invariance property. The Reynolds stress anisotropy predictions of this invariant neural network are propagated through to the velocity field for two test cases.

On this manifold, the state of the system can be exactly described in a coordinate system parameterising the manifold. Describing the system in this low-dimensional coordinate system allows for much faster simulations and analysis. We show, for turbulent Couette flow, that this description of the dynamics is possible using a data-driven manifold dynamics modelling method. This approach consists of an autoencoder to find a low-dimensional manifold coordinate system and a set of ordinary differential equations defined by a neural network. Specifically, we apply this method to minimal flow unit turbulent plane Couette flow at {$\mathsl{R}\mathsl{e}$}=400Re=400Re=400, where a fully resolved solutions requires {$\mathsl{O}$}(105)O(105)\{O\}(10\^5) degrees of freedom. Using only data from this simulation we build models with fewer than 202020 degrees of freedom that quantitatively capture key characteristics of the flow, including the streak breakdown and regeneration cycle. At short times, the models track the true trajectory for multiple Lyapunov times and, at long times, the models capture the Reynolds stress and the energy balance. For comparison, we show that the models outperform POD-Galerkin models with {$\sim\sim\backslash$}sim2000 degrees of freedom. Finally, we compute unstable periodic orbits from the models. Many of these closely resemble previously computed orbits for the full system; in addition, we find nine orbits that correspond to previously unknown solutions in the full system.},

The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a novel Koopman-based technique that effectively dissects high-dimensional nonlinear systems into periodically distinct constituents on reduced-order subspaces. As a novel mathematical hatchling, the DMD bears vast potentials yet an equal degree of unknown. This effort investigates the nuances of DMD sampling with an engineering-oriented emphasis. It aimed at elucidating how sampling range and resolution affect the convergence of DMD modes. We employed the most classical nonlinear system in fluid mechanics as the test subject{\textemdash}the turbulent free-shear flow over a prism{\textemdash}for optimal pertinency. We numerically simulated the flow by the dynamic-stress Large-Eddies Simulation with Near-Wall Resolution. With the large-quantity, high-fidelity data, we parametrized and identified four global convergence states: Initialization, Transition, Stabilization, and Divergence with increasing sampling range. Results showed that Stabilization is the optimal state for modal convergence, in which DMD output becomes independent of the sampling range. The Initialization state also yields sufficient accuracy for most system reconstruction tasks. Moreover, defying popular beliefs, over-sampling causes algorithmic instability: as the temporal dimension, n, approaches and transcends the spatial dimension, m (i.e., m\,{$<$}\,n), the output diverges and becomes meaningless. Additionally, the convergence of the sampling resolution depends on the mode-specific dynamics, such that the resolution of 15 frames per cycle for target activities is suggested for most engineering implementations. Finally, a bi-parametric study revealed that the convergence of the sampling range and resolution are mutually independent.},

In addition, sparsity-enhancing strategies have been introduced to GEPNN to improve the interpretability of the trained models. The GEPNN method has been tested for finding different physical laws, showing improved convergence to models with precise coefficients. Furthermore, for large-eddy simulation of turbulence, the subgrid-scale stress model trained by GEPNN significantly improves the prediction of turbulence statistics and flow structures over traditional models, showing advantages compared to the existing GEP and ANN methods in both a priori and a posteriori tests.},

The recursion of the filtering can be characterized by the composition of Perron-Frobenius operator and likelihood operator. This gives a significant connection between the Perron-Frobenius operator and Bayesian filtering. We numerically fulfil the recursion through approximating the Perron-Frobenius operator by Ulam's method. In this way, the posterior measure is represented by a convex combination of the indicator functions in Ulam's method. To get a low rank approximation for the Perron-Frobenius operator filter, we take a spectral decomposition for the posterior measure by using the eigenfunctions of the discretized Perron-Frobenius operator. A convergence analysis is carried out and shows that the Perron-Frobenius operator filter achieves a higher convergence rate than the particle filter, which uses Dirac measures for the posterior. The proposed method is explored for the data assimilation of the stochastic dynamical systems. A few numerical examples are presented to illustrate the advantage of the Perron-Frobenius operator filter over particle filter and extend Kalman filter.},

Instead, the most parsimonious nonlinear model is determined that is consistent with observed measurement data and satisfies necessary constraints. Galerkin regression models also readily generalize to include higher-order nonlinear terms that model the effect of truncated modes. The effectiveness of such an approach is demonstrated on two canonical flow configurations: the two-dimensional flow past a circular cylinder and the shear-driven cavity flow.

After having reviewed the physical properties the reduced-order model should exhibit, the latter is identified using SINDy, an increasingly popular and flexible framework for the identification of nonlinear continuous-time dynamical systems from data. The identified model closely resembles the canonical Lorenz system, having the same structure and exhibiting the same physical properties.

Results from the global stability analyses highlight the unstable nature of the central low-speed region and its crucial importance in the laminar{\textendash}turbulent transition process. It is able to sustain two different global instabilities: a sinuous and a varicose one. Each of these globally unstable modes is related to a different physical mechanism. While the varicose mode has its root in the instability of the whole three-dimensional shear layer surrounding the central low-speed region, the sinuous instability turns out to be similar to the von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n instability in the two-dimensional cylinder wake and has its root in the lateral shear layers of the separated zone. The aspect ratio of the roughness element plays a key role on the selection of the dominant instability: whereas the flow over thin cylindrical roughness elements transitions due to a sinuous instability of the near-wake region, for larger roughness elements the varicose instability of the central low-speed region turns out to be the dominant one. Direct numerical simulations of the flow past an aspect ratio {$\eta$}=1{$\eta$}=1\{{\textbackslash}it{\textbackslash}eta\}=1 (with {$\eta$}=d/h{$\eta$}=d/h\{{\textbackslash}it{\textbackslash}eta\}=d/h) roughness element sustaining only the sinuous instability have revealed that the bifurcation occurring in this particular case is supercritical. Finally, comparison of the transition thresholds predicted by global linear stability analyses with the von Doenhoff{\textendash}Braslow transition diagram provides qualitatively good agreement.},

  abstract = {We propose a general dynamic reduced-order modelling framework for typical experimental data: time-resolved sensor data and optional non-time-resolved particle image velocimetry (PIV) snapshots. This framework can be decomposed into four building blocks. First, the sensor signals are lifted to a dynamic feature space without false neighbours. Second, we identify a sparse human-interpretable nonlinear dynamical system for the feature state based on the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy). Third, if PIV snapshots are available, a local linear mapping from the feature state to the velocity field is performed to reconstruct the full state of the system. Fourth, a generalized feature-based modal decomposition identifies coherent structures that are most dynamically correlated with the linear and nonlinear interaction terms in the sparse model, adding interpretability. Steps 1 and 2 define a black-box model. Optional steps 3 and 4 lift the black-box dynamics to a grey-box model in terms of the identified coherent structures, if non-time-resolved full-state data are available. This grey-box modelling strategy is successfully applied to the transient and post-transient laminar cylinder wake, and compares favourably with a proper orthogonal decomposition model. We foresee numerous applications of this highly flexible modelling strategy, including estimation, prediction and control. Moreover, the feature space may be based on intrinsic coordinates, which are unaffected by a key challenge of modal expansion: the slow change of low-dimensional coherent structures with changing geometry and varying parameters.},

However, recent advances of technology enable us to collect and store massive amount of data, which offers new opportunities for data-driven discovery of PDEs. In this paper, we propose a new deep neural network, called PDE-Net 2.0, to discover (time-dependent) PDEs from observed dynamic data with minor prior knowledge on the underlying mechanism that drives the dynamics. The design of PDE-Net 2.0 is based on our earlier work [1] where the original version of PDE-Net was proposed. PDE-Net 2.0 is a combination of numerical approximation of differential operators by convolutions and a symbolic multi-layer neural network for model recovery. Comparing with existing approaches, PDE-Net 2.0 has the most flexibility and expressive power by learning both differential operators and the nonlinear response function of the underlying PDE model. Numerical experiments show that the PDE-Net 2.0 has the potential to uncover the hidden PDE of the observed dynamics, and predict the dynamical behavior for a relatively long time, even in a noisy environment.},

In this work, a robust and ``tune-free'' sampler is proposed to extend one of the sequential Monte Carlo implementations for the identification of time-varying parameters which can be assumed constant within each set of data collected but might vary across different sequences of datasets. The proposed approach involves the implementation of the affine-invariant Ensemble sampler in place of the Metropolis{\textendash}Hastings sampler to update the samples. An adaptive-tuning algorithm is also proposed to automatically tune the step-size of the affine-invariant ensemble sampler which, in turn, controls the acceptance rate of the samples across iterations. Furthermore, a numerical investigation behind the existence of inherent lower and upper bounds on the acceptance rate, making the algorithm robust by design, is also conducted. The proposed method allows for the off-line and on-line identification of the most probable models under uncertainty. The proposed sampling strategy is first verified against the existing sequential Monte Carlo sampler in a numerical example. Then, it is validated by identifying the time-varying parameters and the most probable model of a nonlinear dynamical system using experimental data.},

In the offline stage, the reduced basis functions are extracted by a two-step proper orthogonal decomposition algorithm. Then, a novel hybrid DMD regression model that combines windowed DMD and optimized DMD is introduced for the temporal evolution of the RB coefficients. To improve the stability of this method for complex nonlinear problems, we introduce a threshold value to modify the DMD eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Moreover, the interpolation of the coefficients in parameter space is conducted by a feedforward neural network or random forest algorithm. The prediction of the RB solution at a new time/parameter value can be recovered at a low computational cost in the online stage, which is completely decoupled from the high-fidelity dimension. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed model with two cases: (i) laminar flow past a two-dimensional cylinder and (ii) turbulent flow around a three-dimensional SD7003 airfoil.

We present results for a synthetic Helmholtz acoustics model problem to illustrate the elements of the methodology and confirm the numerical properties suggested by the theory. To conclude, we consider a physical raised-box acoustic resonator chamber: we integrate the PBDW methodology and a Robotic Observation Platform to achieve real-time in situ state estimation of the time-harmonic pressure field; we demonstrate the considerable improvement in prediction provided by the integration of a best-knowledge model and experimental observations; we extract, even from these results with real data, the numerical trends indicated by the theoretical convergence and stability analyses.

Using a recently developed sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics algorithm, the sub-selection of candidate models near the Pareto frontier allows feasible computation of Akaike information criteria (AIC) or Bayes information criteria scores for the remaining candidate models. The information criteria hierarchically ranks the most informative models, enabling the automatic and principled selection of the model with the strongest support in relation to the time-series data. Specifically, we show that AIC scores place each candidate model in the strong support, weak support or no support category. The method correctly recovers several canonical dynamical systems, including a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered disease model, Burgers' equation and the Lorenz equations, identifying the correct dynamical system as the only candidate model with strong support.},

Nearly every downstream control decision is affected by these sensor and actuator locations, but determining optimal locations amounts to an intractable brute-force search among the combinatorial possibilities. Indeed, there are (np) = n!/((n-p)!p!) possible choices of p point sensors out of an n-dimensional state x. Determining optimal sensor and actuator placement in general, even for linear feedback control, is an open challenge. Instead, sensor and actuator locations are routinely chosen according to heuristics and intuition. For moderate-sized search spaces, the sensor placement problem has well-known model-based solutions using optimal experiment design [1], [2], and information theoretic and Bayesian criteria [3]-[7]. As discussed in "Summary," this article explores how to design optimal sensor locations for signal reconstruction in a framework that scales to arbitrarily large problems, leveraging modern techniques in machine learning and sparse sampling. Reducing the number of sensors through principled selection may be critically enabling when sensors are costly, and it may also enable faster state estimation for low-latency, high-bandwidth control.},

In this way we can estimate energy functions (or Hamiltonians) and efficiently generate new samples of many-body systems in various domains, from statistical physics to cosmology. Our method -- the Wavelet Conditional Renormalization Group (WC-RG) -- proceeds scale by scale, estimating models for the conditional probabilities of "fast degrees of freedom" conditioned by coarse-grained fields. These probability distributions are modeled by energy functions associated with scale interactions, and are represented in an orthogonal wavelet basis. WC-RG decomposes the microscopic energy function as a sum of interaction energies at all scales and can efficiently generate new samples by going from coarse to fine scales. Near phase transitions, it avoids the "critical slowing down" of direct estimation and sampling algorithms. This is explained theoretically by combining results from RG and wavelet theories, and verified numerically for the Gaussian and \${\textbackslash}varphi\^4\$ field theories. We show that multiscale WC-RG energy-based models are more general than local potential models and can capture the physics of complex many-body interacting systems at all length scales. This is demonstrated for weak-gravitational-lensing fields reflecting dark matter distributions in cosmology, which include long-range interactions with long-tail probability distributions.

In the present study, we address this issue for fluid flows in rectangular channels by formulating a continuous symmetry reduction method that eliminates the translations in the streamwise and spanwise directions simultaneously. We demonstrate our method by computing the symmetry-reduced dynamic mode decomposition (SRDMD) of sliding windows of data obtained from the transitional plane-Couette and turbulent plane-Poiseuille flow simulations.

  abstract = {This survey presents recent research on determining control-theoretic properties and designing controllers with rigorous guarantees and for nonlinear systems for which no mathematical models but measured trajectories are available. Data-driven control techniques have been developed to circumvent a time-consuming modelling by first principles and because of the increasing availability of data. Recently, this research field has gained increased attention by the application of Willems' fundamental lemma, which provides a fertile ground for the development of data-driven control schemes with guarantees for linear time-invariant systems. While the fundamental lemma can be generalized to further system classes, there does not exist a comparable comprising theory for nonlinear systems. At the same time, nonlinear systems constitute the majority of practical systems. Moreover, they include additional challenges such as nonconvex optimization and data-based surrogate models that prevent end-to-end guarantees. Therefore, a variety of data-driven control approaches has been developed with different required prior insights into the system to ensure a guaranteed inference. In this survey, we will discuss developments in the context of data-driven control for nonlinear systems. In particular, we will focus on approaches providing guarantees from finite data, while the analysis and the controller design are computationally tractable due to semidefinite programming. Thus, these approaches achieve reasonable advances compared to the state-of-the-art system analysis and controller design by models from system identification.},

  abstract = {Global instability analysis of flows is often performed via time-stepping methods, based on the Arnoldi algorithm. When setting up these methods, several computational parameters must be chosen, which affect intrinsic errors of the procedure, such as the truncation errors, the discretization error of the flow solver, the error associated with the nonlinear terms of the Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations and the error associated with the limited size of the approximation of the Jacobian matrix. This paper develops theoretical equations for the estimation of optimal balance between accuracy and cost for each case. The 2D open cavity flow is used both for explaining the effect of the parameters on the accuracy and the cost of the solution, and for verifying the quality of the predictions. The equations demonstrate the impact of each parameter on the quality of the solution. For example, if higher-order methods are used for approaching a Fr{\'e}chet derivative in the procedure, it is shown that the solution deteriorates more rapidly for larger grids or less accurate flow solvers. On the other hand, lower-order approximations are more sensitive to the initial disturbance magnitude. Nevertheless, for accurate flow solvers and moderate grid dimensions, first-order Fr{\'e}chet derivative approximation with optimal computational parameters can provide 5 decimal place accurate eigenvalues. It is further shown that optimal parameters based on accuracy tend to also lead to the most cost-effective solution. The predictive equations, guidelines and conclusions are general, and, in principle, applicable to any flow, including 3D ones.},

We demonstrate via numerical examples that our estimator can provide significant decreases, up to one order of magnitude, in squared estimation error relative to both single-fidelity and other multifidelity covariance estimators.

The framework consists of the use of Bayesian theory together with advanced Kriging surrogate models to effectively represent the limit cycle oscillation response of nonlinear aeroelastic systems. Three types of sampling methods, namely Markov Chain Monte-Carlo, Transitional Markov Chain Monte-Carlo, and the Sequential Monte-Carlo sampler, are implemented into Bayesian model updating. The framework has been demonstrated using a nonlinear wing flutter test rig. It is modelled by a two-degree-of-freedom aeroelastic system and solved by the harmonic balance methods. The experimental data of the flutter wing is obtained using control-based continuation techniques.  The proposed methodology provided up to 20 \% improvement in accuracy compared to conventional deterministic methods. Transitional Markov Chain Monte-Carlo was identified as the optimal choice of the sampling method for stochastic model identification. In selecting alternative nonlinear models, multi-modal solutions were identified that provided a closer representation of physical behaviour suggesting the mathematical model requires further modification.},

  abstract = {In recent years, many researchers have demonstrated the strength of supervised machine learning for flow state estimation. Most of the studies assume that the sensors are fixed and the high-resolution ground truth can be prepared. However, the sensors are not always fixed and may be floating in practical situations -- for example, in oceanography and river hydraulics, sensors are generally floating. In addition, floating sensors make it more difficult to collect the high-resolution ground truth. We here propose a machine learning model for state estimation from such floating sensors without requiring high-resolution ground-truth data for training. This model estimates velocity fields only from floating sensor measurements and is trained with a loss function using only sensor locations. We call this loss function as a "semi-supervised" loss function, since the sensor measurements are utilized as the ground truth but high-resolution data of the entire velocity fields are not required. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed model, we consider Stokes' second problem and two-dimensional decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence. Our results reveal that the proposed semi-supervised model can estimate velocity fields with reasonable accuracy when the appropriate number of sensors are spatially distributed to some extent in the domain. We also discuss the dependence of the estimation accuracy on the number and distribution of sensors.},

  abstract = {Kalman's minimal realization theory involves geometric objects (controllable, unobservable subspaces) which are subject to structural instability. Specifically, arbitrarily small perturbations in a model may cause a change in the dimensions of the associated subspaces. This situation is manifested in computational difficulties which arise in attempts to apply textbook algorithms for computing a minimal realization. Structural instability associated with geometric theories is not unique to control; it arises in the theory of linear equations as well. In this setting, the computational problems have been studied for decades and excellent tools have been developed for coping with the situation. One of the main goals of this paper is to call attention to principal component analysis (Hotelling, 1933), and an algorithm (Golub and Reinsch, 1970) for computing the singular value decompositon of a matrix. Together they form a powerful tool for coping with structural instability in dynamic systems. As developed in this paper, principal component analysis is a technique for analyzing signals. (Singular value decomposition provides the computational machinery.) For this reason, Kalman's minimal realization theory is recast in terms of responses to injected signals. Application of the signal analysis to controllability and observability leads to a coordinate system in which the "internally balanced" model has special properties. For asymptotically stable systems, this yields working approximations ofX\_c, X\_{\textbackslash}baro, the controllable and unobservable subspaces. It is proposed that a natural first step in model reduction is to apply the mechanics of minimal realization using these working subspaces.},

  abstract = {Recent literature has shown how linear time-invariant (LTI) systems can be represented by trajectories features, that is relying on a single input-output (IO) data dictionary to span all possible system trajectories, as long as the input is persistently exciting. The so-called behavioural framework is a promising alternative for controller synthesis without the necessity of system identification. In this paper, we benefit from differential inclusion in order to adapt previous results to the case quasi-Linear Parameter Varying (qLPV) embeddings, which are use to represent nonlinear dynamical systems along suitable IO coordinates. Accordingly, we propose a set of data-driven analysis tools for a wide class of nonlinear systems, which enable nonlinear data-driven simulation and predictions. Furthermore, a parameter-dependent dissipativity analysis verification setup is also presented, which serves to assess stability of the system within a bounded operation region. The major requirement is that there should exist a scheduling function which maps the nonlinear outputs into a finite number of scheduling variables, and this function should be analytically known. The effectiveness of the proposed tools is tested in practice and shown to provide accurate descriptions of the nonlinear dynamics by the means of a linear representation structure. For such, we consider a high-fidelity nonlinear simulator of a rotational pendulum benchmark simulator and an electro-mechanical positioning experimental validation test-bench. We also show that, even if the scheduling function is erroneously selected, the proposed framework is still able to offer a trustworthy representation of the output dynamics.},

By sampling from the inferred distributions, we obtain a distribution over dynamical models, which in turn provides a distribution over possible outcomes as a modeled system advances in time. Experiments show that the DVK model is effective at long-term prediction for a variety of dynamical systems. Furthermore, we describe how to incorporate the learned models into a control framework, and demonstrate that accounting for the uncertainty present in the distribution over dynamical models enables more effective control.},

These models are realized via combining spatio-temporally coherent spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) modes extracted directly from Lighthill's stress tensor, itself calculated using large-eddy simulation (LES). We consider two sets of twin subsonic jets of diameter {$\mathsl{D}$}DD each, with spacings of 0.1{$\mathsl{D}$}0.1D0.1D and 1{$\mathsl{D}$}1D1D, where the jets merge upstream and downstream of breakdown, respectively. The closely spaced twin jet decays the slowest due to reduced turbulent stresses which are, however, more broadband due to early merging. Such jets show strong shielding in the plane of jets, especially at shallow directivity angles where sound levels may drop below that of the single jet. The farther spaced twin jets have dynamics more akin to the constituent single jet with turbulent fluctuations peaking here at {$\mathsl{S}\mathsl{t}$}=0.34St=0.34St=0.34, but showing very little shielding, with their overall sound pressure level (OASPL) mostly linked to the nature of extra flow structures created during merging. Three-dimensional, energy-ranked, coherent structures for twin jets exhibit rather poor low-rank behaviour, especially at the far-field spectral peak {$\mathsl{S}\mathsl{t}$}=0.14St=0.14St=0.14. At {$\mathsl{S}\mathsl{t}\greaterequivlnt$}0.3St{$\greaterequivlnt$}0.3St {\textbackslash}gtrsim 0.3, the SPOD wavepackets show strong visual coherence, resembling Kelvin{\textendash}Helmholtz instability modes upstream of breakdown, while at the lower frequencies, there is very little spatial coherence with wavepackets peaking downstream of breakdown.

The proposed method can avoid the difficulty of sensor selection with strongly correlated measurement noise, in which the possible sensor locations must be known in advance for calculating the precision matrix for selecting sensor locations. The problem can be efficiently solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers, and the computational complexity of the proposed method is proportional to the number of potential sensor locations when it is used in combination with a low-rank expression of the measurement noise model.

In one approach, the wake vortices and bound vortexlets form the nodes of the network with the edges defined by induced velocity. In the other approach, coherent structures (fluid modes) contributing to the kinetic energy of the flow and structural modes contributing to the kinetic energy of the compliant structure constitute the network nodes. The energy transfers between the modes are extracted using a perturbation approach. The network structure of the FSI system is further simplified using the community detection algorithm in the vortical approach and by selecting dominant modes in the modal approach. Network measures are used to reveal the temporal behavior of the individual nodes within the simplified FSI system. Predictive models are then built using both data-driven and physics-based methods. We conclude by investigating the controllability of the modal interaction network. This work sets the foundation for network-theoretic reduced-order modeling of fluid-structure interactions, generalizable to other multi-physics systems.},

  abstract = {Unsteady bluff-body flows exhibit dominant oscillatory behaviour owing to periodic vortex shedding. The ability to manipulate this vortex shedding is critical to improving the aerodynamic performance of bodies in a flow. This goal requires a precise understanding of how the perturbations affect the asymptotic behaviour of the oscillatory flow and of the ability to control transient dynamics. In this work, we develop an energy-efficient flow-control strategy to alter the oscillation phase of time-periodic fluid flows rapidly. First, we perform a phase-sensitivity analysis to construct a reduced-order model for the response of the flow oscillation to impulsive control inputs at various phases. Next, we introduce a real-time optimal phase-control strategy based on the phase-sensitivity function obtained by solving the associated Euler{\textendash}Lagrange equations as a two-point boundary-value problem. Our approach is demonstrated for the incompressible laminar flow past a circular cylinder and an airfoil. We show the effectiveness of phase control with different actuation inputs, including blowing and rotary control. Moreover, our control approach is a sensor-based approach without the need for access to high-dimensional measurements of the entire flow field.},

  abstract = {Machine learning methods have revolutionized studies in several areas of knowledge, helping to understand and extract information from experimental data. Recently, these data-driven methods have also been used to discover structures of mathematical models. The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) method has been proposed with the aim of identifying nonlinear dynamical systems, assuming that the equations have only a few important terms that govern the dynamics. By defining a library of possible terms, the SINDy approach solves a sparse regression problem by eliminating terms whose coefficients are smaller than a threshold. However, the choice of this threshold is decisive for the correct identification of the model structure. In this work, we build on the SINDy method by integrating it with a global sensitivity analysis (SA) technique that allows to hierarchize terms according to their importance in relation to the desired quantity of interest, thus circumventing the need to define the SINDy threshold. The proposed SINDy-SA framework also includes the formulation of different experimental settings, recalibration of each identified model, and the use of model selection techniques to select the best and most parsimonious model. We investigate the use of the proposed SINDy-SA framework in a variety of applications. We also compare the results against the original SINDy method. The results demonstrate that the SINDy-SA framework is a promising methodology to accurately identify interpretable data-driven models.},

First-principle derivations of the underlying transitions can be characterized using bifurcation theory on model systems whose governing equations are known.

Here, we develop a data-driven approach sparse identification for nonlinear dynamics with control parameters (SINDyCP) to discover dynamics for systems with adjustable control parameters, such as an external driving strength. We demonstrate the method on systems of varying complexity, ranging from discrete maps to systems of partial differential equations. To mitigate the impact of measurement noise, we also develop a weak formulation of SINDyCP and assess its performance on noisy data. Applications include the discovery of universal pattern-formation equations, and their bifurcation dependencies, directly from experimental data and the extrapolation of predictions beyond the weakly nonlinear regime near the onset of an instability.},

Unlike POD modes, RDMD structures are shown to have purer frequency content while retaining a residual of comparable order to POD. In contrast to DMD, with exponentially growing or decaying oscillatory amplitudes, RDMD clearly identifies initial, maximum and final fluctuation levels. Intriguingly, RDMD outperforms both POD and DMD in the limit-cycle resolution from the same snapshots. Robustness of these observations is demonstrated for other parameters of the cylinder wake and for a more complex wake behind three rotating cylinders. Recursive DMD is proposed as an attractive alternative to POD and DMD for empirical Galerkin models, in particular for nonlinear transient dynamics.},

In this study, we focus on stochastic differential equations, and a method to obtain the Koopman matrix is proposed. The proposed method does not need any data set, which employs the original system equations to evaluate some of the targeted elements of the Koopman matrix. The proposed method comprises combinatorics, an approximation of the resolvent, and extrapolations. Comparisons with the EDMD are performed for a noisy van der Pol system.

  abstract = {Recently developed reduced-order modeling techniques aim to approximate nonlinear dynamical systems on low-dimensional manifolds learned from data. This is an effective approach for modeling dynamics in a post-transient regime where the effects of initial conditions and other disturbances have decayed. However, modeling transient dynamics near an underlying manifold, as needed for real-time control and forecasting applications, is complicated by the effects of fast dynamics and nonnormal sensitivity mechanisms. To begin to address these issues, we introduce a parametric class of nonlinear projections described by constrained autoencoder neural networks in which both the manifold and the projection fibers are learned from data. Our architecture uses invertible activation functions and biorthogonal weight matrices to ensure that the encoder is a left inverse of the decoder. We also introduce new dynamics-aware cost functions that promote learning of oblique projection fibers that account for fast dynamics and nonnormality. To demonstrate these methods and the specific challenges they address, we provide a detailed case study of a three-state model of vortex shedding in the wake of a bluff body immersed in a fluid, which has a two-dimensional slow manifold that can be computed analytically. In anticipation of future applications to high-dimensional systems, we also propose several techniques for constructing computationally efficient reduced-order models using our proposed nonlinear projection framework. This includes a novel sparsity-promoting penalty for the encoder that avoids detrimental weight matrix shrinkage via computation on the Grassmann manifold.},

  abstract = {Data-driven reduced-order models often fail to make accurate forecasts of high-dimensional nonlinear systems that are sensitive along coordinates with low-variance because such coordinates are often truncated, e.g., by proper orthogonal decomposition, kernel principal component analysis, and autoencoders. Such systems are encountered frequently in shear-dominated fluid flows where non-normality plays a significant role in the growth of disturbances. In order to address these issues, we employ ideas from active subspaces to find low-dimensional systems of coordinates for model reduction that balance adjoint-based information about the system's sensitivity with the variance of states along trajectories. The resulting method, which we refer to as covariance balancing reduction using adjoint snapshots (CoBRAS), is analogous to balanced truncation with state and adjoint-based gradient covariance matrices replacing the system Gramians and obeying the same key transformation laws. Here, the extracted coordinates are associated with an oblique projection that can be used to construct Petrov-Galerkin reduced-order models. We provide an efficient snapshot-based computational method analogous to balanced proper orthogonal decomposition. This also leads to the observation that the reduced coordinates can be computed relying on inner products of state and gradient samples alone, allowing us to find rich nonlinear coordinates by replacing the inner product with a kernel function. In these coordinates, reduced-order models can be learned using regression. We demonstrate these techniques and compare to a variety of other methods on a simple, yet challenging three-dimensional system and an axisymmetric jet flow simulation with \$10\^5\$ state variables.},

  abstract = {Reduced-order modeling techniques, including balanced truncation and \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{H\}\_2\$-optimal model reduction, exploit the structure of linear dynamical systems to produce models that accurately capture the dynamics. For nonlinear systems operating far away from equilibria, on the other hand, current approaches seek low-dimensional representations of the state that often neglect low-energy features that have high dynamical significance. For instance, low-energy features are known to play an important role in fluid dynamics where they can be a driving mechanism for shear-layer instabilities. Neglecting these features leads to models with poor predictive accuracy despite being able to accurately encode and decode states. In order to improve predictive accuracy, we propose to optimize the reduced-order model to fit a collection of coarsely sampled trajectories from the original system. In particular, we optimize over the product of two Grassmann manifolds defining Petrov-Galerkin projections of the full-order governing equations. We compare our approach with existing methods including proper orthogonal decomposition, balanced truncation-based Petrov-Galerkin projection, quadratic-bilinear balanced truncation, and the quadratic-bilinear iterative rational Krylov algorithm. Our approach demonstrates significantly improved accuracy both on a nonlinear toy model and on an incompressible (nonlinear) axisymmetric jet flow with \$10\^5\$ states.},

In the last few years, several works have shown that finite-dimensional approximations of this operator can be extremely useful for several applications, such as prediction, control, and data assimilation. In particular, a Koopman representation of a dynamical system with a finite number of dimensions will avoid all the problems caused by nonlinearity in classical state-space models. In this work, the identification of finite-dimensional approximations of the Koopman operator and its associated observables is expressed through the inversion of an unknown augmented linear dynamical system. The proposed framework can be regarded as an extended dynamical mode decomposition that uses a collection of latent observables. The use of a latent dictionary applies to a large class of dynamical regimes, and it provides new means for deriving appropriate finite-dimensional linear approximations to high-dimensional nonlinear systems.},

  abstract = {Generally, reduced order models of fluid flows are obtained by projecting the Navier-Stokes equations onto a reduced subspace spanned by vector functions that carry the meaningful information of the dynamics. A common method to generate such subspace is the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. This projection strategy is intrusive since it assumes that the approximation model used to solve the high fidelity flow problem is known and accessible. In the present article, we propose a non-intrusive paradigm based on Machine Learning to build Closed Parametric Reduced Order Models (ML-PROM) relevant to fluid dynamics. With no prior knowledge requirement of the approximation model, this method is purely data-driven as it operates directly on data regardless their origin, DNS, RANS simulations or experiment. The key idea to build the ML-CPROM is to use the generally known form of Galerkin ROMs and assimilate the time variations of the temporal POD modes to a nonlinear quadratic form taking a closure right hand side member. This last term is introduced to account for uncaptured dynamics due to data noise, POD truncation errors and time integration schemes. For parameter variation, the ML-CPROM is updated by interpolation on the quotient manifold of the set of fixed rank matrices by the orthogonal group. The predicted closure term is afterwards calculated by a Long-Short-Term-Memory neural network. We assess the potential of the proposed approach on the parametric examples of the lid-driven cavity flow and the flow past a cylinder by varying the Reynolds number through the viscosity, and the Ahmed-Body flow by varying the geometry through the rear slant angle. We show on these examples that our method enables to recover the dynamics with a good accuracy, not only for the training parameter points, but also for unseen parameter values for which the model was not priory trained.},

  abstract = {Reduced-order models for flows that exhibit time-periodic behavior are critical for several tasks, including active control and optimization. One well-known procedure to obtain the desired reduced-order model in the proximity of a periodic solution of the governing equations is continuous-time balanced truncation. Within this framework, the periodic reachability and observability Gramians are usually estimated numerically via quadrature using the forward and adjoint post-transient response to impulses. However, this procedure can be computationally expensive, especially in the presence of slowly-decaying transients. Moreover, it can only be performed if the periodic orbit is stable in the sense of Floquet. In order to address these issues, we use the frequency-domain representation of the Gramians, which we henceforth refer to as frequential Gramians. First, these frequential Gramians are well-defined for both stable and unstable dynamics. In particular, we show that when the underlying system is unstable, these Gramians satisfy a pair of allied differential Lyapunov equations. Second, they can be estimated numerically by solving algebraic systems of equations that lend themselves to heavy computational parallelism and that deliver the desired post-transient response without having to follow physical transients. We demonstrate the method on a periodically-forced axisymmetric jet at Reynolds numbers Re=1250 and Re=1500. At the lower Reynolds number, the flow strongly amplifies subharmonic perturbations and exhibits vortex pairing about a Floquet-stable T-periodic solution. At the higher Reynolds number, the underlying T-periodic orbit is unstable and the flow naturally settles onto a 2T-periodic limit cycle characterized by pairing vortices. At both Reynolds numbers, we use a balanced reduced-order model to design a feedback controller and a state estimator to suppress vortex pairing.},

  abstract = {Computing reduced-order models using non-intrusive methods is particularly attractive for systems that are simulated using black-box solvers. However, obtaining accurate data-driven models can be challenging, especially if the underlying systems exhibit large-amplitude transient growth. Although these systems may evolve near a low-dimensional subspace that can be easily identified using standard techniques such as Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), computing accurate models often requires projecting the state onto this subspace via a non-orthogonal projection. While appropriate oblique projection operators can be computed using intrusive techniques that leverage the form of the underlying governing equations, purely data-driven methods currently tend to achieve dimensionality reduction via orthogonal projections, and this can lead to models with poor predictive accuracy. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing a non-intrusive framework designed to simultaneously identify oblique projection operators and reduced-order dynamics. In particular, given training trajectories and assuming reduced-order dynamics of polynomial form, we fit a reduced-order model by solving an optimization problem over the product manifold of a Grassmann manifold, a Stiefel manifold, and several linear spaces (as many as the tensors that define the low-order dynamics). Furthermore, we show that the gradient of the cost function with respect to the optimization parameters can be conveniently written in closed-form, so that there is no need for automatic differentiation. We compare our formulation with state-of-the-art methods on three examples: a three-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations, the complex Ginzburg-Landau (CGL) equation, and a two-dimensional lid-driven cavity flow at Reynolds number Re = 8300.},

The objective of the present paper is to enhance the understanding of the physical mechanics behind two-dimensional transonic buffet. The paper is composed of two parts. In the first part, a global stability analysis based on the linearized Reynolds-averaged Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations is performed. A recently developed technique, based on the direct and adjoint unstable global modes, is used to compute the local contribution of the flow to the growth rate and angular frequency of the unstable global mode. The results allow us to identify which zones are directly responsible for the existence of the instability. The technique is firstly used for the vortex-shedding cylinder mode, as a validating case. In the second part, in order to confirm the results of the first part, a selective frequency damping method is locally used in some regions of the flow field. This method consists of applying a low-pass filter on selected zones of the computational domain in order to damp the fluctuations. It allows us to identify which zones are necessary for the persistence of the instability. The two different approaches give the same results: the shock foot is identified as the core of the instability; the shock and the boundary layer downstream of the shock are also necessary zones while damping the fluctuations on the lower surface of the airfoil; and outside the boundary layer between the shock and the trailing edge or above the supersonic zone does not suppress the shock oscillation. A discussion on the several physical models, proposed until now for the buffet phenomenon, and a new model are finally offered in the last section.},

Deep reinforcement learning algorithms have been implemented to discover efficient control schemes, using two synthetic jets located on the cylinder's poles as actuators and pressure sensors in the wake of the cylinder as feedback observation. The present work focuses on the efficiency and robustness of the identified control strategy and introduces a novel algorithm (S-PPO-CMA) to optimise the sensor layout. An energy-efficient control strategy reducing drag by 18.4\%18.4\%18.4{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\% at a Reynolds number of 120120120 is obtained. This control policy is shown to be robust both to a Reynolds-number variation in the range [100;216][100;216][100;216] and to measurement noise, for signal-to-noise ratios as low as 0.20.20.2 with negligible impact on performance. Along with a systematic study on sensor number and location, the proposed sparsity-seeking algorithm has achieved a successful optimisation to a reduced five-sensor layout while keeping state-of-the-art performance. These results further highlight the interesting possibilities of reinforcement learning for active flow control and pave the way to efficient, robust and practical implementations of these control techniques in experimental or industrial systems.},

In this study, we bridge this gap using Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) constrained by the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and accurate sparse pointwise mean velocity measurements for data assimilation (DA). Firstly, by constraining the PINN with sparse data and the under-determined RANS equations without closure, we show that the mean flow is reconstructed to a higher accuracy than a RANS solver using the Spalart-Allmaras (SA) turbulence model. Secondly, we propose the SA turbulence model augmented PINN (PINN-DA-SA), which outperforms the former approach - up to 73\% reduction in mean velocity reconstruction error with coarse measurements. The additional SA physics constraints improve flow reconstructions in regions with high velocity and pressure gradients and separation. Thirdly, we compare the PINN-DA-SA approach to a variational data assimilation using the same sparse velocity measurements and physics constraints. The PINN-DA-SA achieves lower reconstruction error across a range of data resolutions. This is attributed to discretisation errors in the variational methodology that are avoided by PINNs. We demonstrate the method using high fidelity measurements from direct numerical simulation of the turbulent periodic hill at Re=5600.},

It is nowadays possible to make accurate predictions of complex systems such as the weather, disease models or the stock market. Predictive methods are often advertised to be useful for control, but the specifics are frequently left unanswered due to the higher system complexity, the requirement of larger data sets and an increased modeling effort. In other words, surrogate modeling for autonomous systems is much easier than for control systems. In this paper we present the framework QuaSiModO (Quantization-Simulation-Modeling-Optimization) to transform arbitrary predictive models into control systems and thus render the tremendous advances in data-driven surrogate modeling accessible for control. Our main contribution is that we trade control efficiency by autonomizing the dynamics {\textendash} which yields mixed-integer control problems {\textendash} to gain access to arbitrary, ready-to-use autonomous surrogate modeling techniques. We then recover the complexity of the original problem by leveraging recent results from mixed-integer optimization. The advantages of QuaSiModO are a linear increase in data requirements with respect to the control dimension, performance guarantees that rely exclusively on the accuracy of the predictive model in use, and little prior knowledge requirements in control theory to solve complex control problems.},

Further increasing the Reynolds number eventually triggers self-sustained periodic oscillations of the flow in the vicinity of the spanwise end walls of the cavity. This secondary instability causes the emergence of a new set of Taylor{\textendash}G{\"o}rtler vortices experiencing a spanwise drift directed toward the spanwise end walls of the cavity. While a two-dimensional stability analysis would fail to capture this secondary instability due to the neglect of the lateral walls, it is the first time to our knowledge that this drifting of the vortices can be entirely characterized by a three-dimensional linear stability analysis of the flow. Good agreements with experimental observations and measurements strongly support our claim that the initial stages of the transition to turbulence of three-dimensional open cavity flows are solely governed by modal instabilities.},

This approach has many appealing characteristics compared to straightforward molecular dynamics simulation and analysis, including the potential to mitigate the sampling problem by extracting long-time kinetic information from short trajectories and the ability to straightforwardly calculate expectation values and statistical uncertainties of various stationary and dynamical molecular observables. In this paper, we summarize the current state of the art in generation and validation of MSMs and give some important new results. We describe an upper bound for the approximation error made by modeling molecular dynamics with a MSM and we show that this error can be made arbitrarily small with surprisingly little effort. In contrast to previous practice, it becomes clear that the best MSM is not obtained by the most metastable discretization, but the MSM can be much improved if non-metastable states are introduced near the transition states. Moreover, we show that it is not necessary to resolve all slow processes by the state space partitioning, but individual dynamical processes of interest can be resolved separately. We also present an efficient estimator for reversible transition matrices and a robust test to validate that a MSM reproduces the kinetics of the molecular dynamics data.},

DMD finds spatial-temporal coherent modes, connects local-linear analysis to nonlinear operator theory, and provides an equation-free architecture which is compatible with compressive sensing. In actuated systems, DMD is incapable of producing an input-output model; moreover, the dynamics and the modes will be corrupted by external forcing. Our new method, dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc), capitalizes on all of the advantages of DMD and provides the additional innovation of being able to disambiguate between the underlying dynamics and the effects of actuation, resulting in accurate input-output models. The method is data-driven in that it does not require knowledge of the underlying governing equations{\textemdash}only snapshots in time of observables and actuation data from historical, experimental, or black-box simulations. We demonstrate the method on high-dimensional dynamical systems, including a model with relevance to the analysis of infectious disease data with mass vaccination (actuation).},

Our experiments aim at providing a comparison to global linear stability theory (LST) by means of hot-film anemometry and particle image velocimetry. Although the critical Reynolds number from theory does not match the transition Reynolds number observed in experiments, there are distinct experimental observations indicating a changeover from purely convective to absolute/global instability very close to the critical Reynolds number predicted by theory. Forcing with a vibrating wire reveals the evolution of the system dynamics from an amplifier to a wavemaker when the critical Reynolds number is exceeded. The mode symmetry is varicose for thick roughness elements and a changeover from varicose to sinuous modes is observed at the critical Reynolds number for thin roughness elements. Therefore, most predictions by global LST can be confirmed, but additional observations in the physical flow demonstrate that not all features can be captured adequately by global LST.},

  abstract = {Subspace identification methods (SIMs) for estimating state-space models have been proven to be very useful and numerically efficient. They exist in several variants, but all have one feature in common: as a first step, a collection of high-order ARX models are estimated from vectorized input{\textendash}output data. In order not to obtain biased estimates, this step must include future outputs. However, all but one of the submodels include non-causal input terms. The coefficients of them will be correctly estimated to zero as more data become available. They still include extra model parameters which give unnecessarily high variance, and also cause bias for closed-loop data. In this paper, a new model formulation is suggested that circumvents the problem. Within the framework, the system matrices (A,B,C,D) and Markov parameters can be estimated separately. It is demonstrated through analysis that the new methods generally give smaller variance in the estimate of the observability matrix and it is supported by simulation studies that this gives lower variance also of the system invariants such as the poles.},

Traditional equations-based approaches leverage first principles to yield predictions through the numerical approximation of high-dimensional systems of differential equations, thus calling for large-scale parallel computing platforms and requiring large computational costs. Data-driven approaches, instead, enable the description of systems evolution in low-dimensional latent spaces, by leveraging dimensionality reduction and deep learning algorithms. We propose a novel architecture, named Latent Dynamics Network (LDNet), which is able to discover low-dimensional intrinsic dynamics of possibly non-Markovian dynamical systems, thus predicting the time evolution of space-dependent fields in response to external inputs. Unlike popular approaches, in which the latent representation of the solution manifold is learned by means of auto-encoders that map a high-dimensional discretization of the system state into itself, LDNets automatically discover a low-dimensional manifold while learning the latent dynamics, without ever operating in the high-dimensional space. Furthermore, LDNets are meshless algorithms that do not reconstruct the output on a predetermined grid of points, but rather at any point of the domain, thus enabling weight-sharing across query-points. These features make LDNets lightweight and easy-to-train, with excellent accuracy and generalization properties, even in time-extrapolation regimes. We validate our method on several test cases and we show that, for a challenging highly-nonlinear problem, LDNets outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy (normalized error 5 times smaller), by employing a dramatically smaller number of trainable parameters (more than 10 times fewer).},

  abstract = {Rapid prediction of the aeroacoustic response is a key component in the design of aircraft and turbomachinery. While it is possible to achieve accurate predictions using direct solution of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, applications of such solvers is not feasible in design optimization due to the high cost of resolving wave phenomena in an Eulerian setting. In this work, we propose a technique for highly accelerated predictions of aeroacoustic response using a data-driven model reduction approach based on the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA), as a non-intrusive balanced truncation method. Specifically, we create and compare ERA ROMs based on the training data generated by solving the linearized and nonlinear Euler equations with Gaussian pulse inputs, and use them for prediction of the aeroacoustic response of an airfoil subject to different types of gust loading. The results show that both ROMs are in good agreement with the full-order model (FOM) solution in a purely predictive setting, while achieving orders of magnitude reduction in the online computation time. Using ERA for prediction of the acoustic response requires activating each input channel separately in the FOM for training ROMs, and operating on a large Hankel matrix, that can become computationally infeasible. We address this bottleneck in two steps: first, we propose a multi-fidelity gappy POD method to identify the most impactful input channels based on a coarser grid. Therefore, we reduce the computation cost on the FOM and ROM levels as we build the Markov sequence by querying the high-resolution FOM only for the input channels identified by gappy POD. Second, we use tangential interpolation at the ROM level to reduce the size of the Hankel matrix. The proposed methods enable application of ERA for highly accurate online acoustic response prediction and reduce the offline computation cost of ROMs.},

  abstract = {Many natural systems exhibit chaotic behavior, including the weather, hydrology, neuroscience, and population dynamics. Although many chaotic systems can be described by relatively simple dynamical equations, characterizing these systems can be challenging due to sensitivity to initial conditions and difficulties in differentiating chaotic behavior from noise. Ideally, one wishes to find a parsimonious set of equations that describe a dynamical system. However, model selection is more challenging when only a subset of the variables are experimentally accessible. Manifold learning methods using time-delay embeddings can successfully reconstruct the underlying structure of the system from data with hidden variables, but not the equations. Recent work in sparse-optimization based model selection has enabled model discovery given a library of possible terms, but regression-based methods require measurements of all state variables. We present a method combining variational annealing{\textemdash}a technique previously used for parameter estimation in chaotic systems with hidden variables{\textemdash}with sparse-optimization methods to perform model identification for chaotic systems with unmeasured variables. We applied the method to ground-truth time-series simulated from the classic Lorenz system and experimental data from an electrical circuit with Lorenz-system like behavior. In both cases, we successfully recover the expected equations with two measured and one hidden variable. Application to simulated data from the Colpitts oscillator demonstrates successful model selection of terms within nonlinear functions. We discuss the robustness of our method to varying noise.},

Laminar separation bubbles are observed over the suction side and near the trailing edge, on the pressure side. Vortex shedding occurs aft of the suction side separation bubble, and vortex interaction results in merging or bursting such that coherent structures or turbulent packets are advected towards the trailing edge. This mechanism modulates the amplitude of the incident pressure signal, leading to different levels of noise emission. Despite the intermittent occurrence of laminar{\textendash}turbulent transition, the noise spectrum depicts a main tone with multiple equidistant secondary tones. To understand the role of flow instabilities on the tones, the linearised Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations are examined in their operator form through biglobal stability and resolvent analyses, and by time evolution of disturbances using a matrix-free method. These linear global analyses reveal amplification of disturbances over the suction side separation bubble. Spanwise-averaged pressure fluctuations elucidate aspects of the acoustic feedback loop mechanism in the nonlinear solutions. This feedback process is self-sustained by acoustic waves radiated from the trailing edge, which reach the most sensitive flow location near the leading edge, as identified by the resolvent analysis. Flow disturbances arising from secondary diffraction and phase interference among the most unstable frequencies computed in the eigenspectrum are shown to have an important role in the feedback loop.},

Model reduction involves finding low-dimensional models that approximate the full high-dimensional dynamics. This paper compares three different methods of model reduction: proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), balanced truncation, and a method called balanced POD. Balanced truncation produces better reduced-order models than POD, but is not computationally tractable for very large systems. Balanced POD is a tractable method for computing approximate balanced truncations, that has computational cost similar to that of POD. The method presented here is a variation of existing methods using empirical Gramians, and the main contributions of the present paper are a version of the method of snapshots that allows one to compute balancing transformations directly, without separate reduction of the Gramians; and an output projection method, which allows tractable computation even when the number of outputs is large. The output projection method requires minimal additional computation, and has a priori error bounds that can guide the choice of rank of the projection. Connections between POD and balanced truncation are also illuminated: in particular, balanced truncation may be viewed as POD of a particular dataset, using the observability Gramian as an inner product. The three methods are illustrated on a numerical example, the linearized flow in a plane channel.}

They have an associated temporal frequency and growth rate and may be viewed as a nonlinear generalization of global eigenmodes of a linearized system. They provide an alternative to proper orthogonal decomposition, and in the case of periodic data the Koopman modes reduce to a discrete temporal Fourier transform. The Arnoldi method used for computations is identical to the dynamic mode decomposition recently proposed by Schmid \& Sesterhenn (Sixty-First Annual Meeting of the APS Division of Fluid Dynamics, 2008), so dynamic mode decomposition can be thought of as an algorithm for finding Koopman modes. We illustrate the method on an example of a jet in crossflow, and show that the method captures the dominant frequencies and elucidates the associated spatial structures.},

  abstract = {, In this paper, sparsity-promoting regression techniques are employed to automatically identify from data relevant triadic interactions between modal structures in large Galerkin-based models of two-dimensional unsteady flows. The approach produces interpretable, sparsely connected models that reproduce the original dynamical behaviour at a much lower computational cost, as fewer triadic interactions need to be evaluated. The key feature of the approach is that dominant interactions are selected systematically from the solution of a convex optimisation problem, with a unique solution, and no a priori assumptions on the structure of scale interactions are required. We demonstrate this approach on models of two-dimensional lid-driven cavity flow at Reynolds number {$\mathsl{R}\mathsl{e}$}=2{\texttimes}104Re=2{\texttimes}104Re = 2 {\textbackslash}times 10\^\{4\}, where fluid motion is chaotic. To understand the role of the subspace utilised for the Galerkin projection in the sparsity characteristics, we consider two families of models obtained from two different modal decomposition techniques. The first uses energy-optimal proper orthogonal decomposition modes, while the second uses modes oscillating at a single frequency obtained from discrete Fourier transform of the flow snapshots. We show that, in both cases, and despite no a priori physical knowledge being incorporated into the approach, relevant interactions across the hierarchy of modes are identified in agreement with the expected picture of scale interactions in two-dimensional turbulence. Yet, substantial structural changes in the interaction pattern and a quantitatively different sparsity are observed. Finally, although not directly enforced in the procedure, the sparsified models have excellent long-term stability properties and correctly reproduce the spatio-temporal evolution of dominant flow structures in the cavity.},

  abstract = {We propose a sparse regression method capable of discovering the governing partial differential equation(s) of a given system by time series measurements in the spatial domain. The regression framework relies on sparsity-promoting techniques to select the nonlinear and partial derivative terms of the governing equations that most accurately represent the data, bypassing a combinatorially large search through all possible candidate models. The method balances model complexity and regression accuracy by selecting a parsimonious model via Pareto analysis. Time series measurements can be made in an Eulerian framework, where the sensors are fixed spatially, or in a Lagrangian framework, where the sensors move with the dynamics. The method is computationally efficient, robust, and demonstrated to work on a variety of canonical problems spanning a number of scientific domains including Navier-Stokes, the quantum harmonic oscillator, and the diffusion equation. Moreover, the method is capable of disambiguating between potentially nonunique dynamical terms by using multiple time series taken with different initial data. Thus, for a traveling wave, the method can distinguish between a linear wave equation and the Korteweg{\textendash}de Vries equation, for instance. The method provides a promising new technique for discovering governing equations and physical laws in parameterized spatiotemporal systems, where first-principles derivations are intractable.},

While some deterministic dynamical systems are not subject to random fluctuations, they do still have a form of uncertainty: Infinitesimal perturbations to the initial conditions can grow exponentially in time, a signature of deterministic chaos. As a measure of this uncertainty, we introduce another classical information, specifically for the deterministic dynamics of classical systems not subject to noise. This classical measure of information is defined with Lyapunov vectors in tangent space, making it less akin to the classical Fisher information and more akin to the quantum Fisher information defined with wavevectors in Hilbert space. Our analysis of the local state space structure and linear stability lead to upper and lower bounds on this information, giving it an interpretation as the net stretching action of the flow. Numerical calculations of this information for illustrative mechanical examples show that it depends directly on the phase space curvature and speed of the flow.},

The tremendous increase in the speed of scientific computing has also made it possible to emulate diverse high-dimensional, multiscale and multiphysics phenomena that contain elements of stochasticity, and to generate large volumes of numerical data for them in heterogeneous systems. The difficulty is, however, that often the governing equations for such phenomena are not known. A prime example is flow, transport, and deformation processes in macroscopically-heterogeneous materials and geomedia. In other cases, the governing equations are only partially known, in the sense that they either contain various coefficients that must be evaluated based on data, or that they require constitutive relations, such as the relationship between the stress tensor and the velocity gradients for non-Newtonian fluids in the momentum conservation equation, in order for them to be useful to the modeling. Several classes of approaches are emerging to address such problems that are based on machine learning, symbolic regression, the Mori-Zwanzig projection operator formulation, sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics, data assimilation, and stochastic optimization and analysis, or a combination of two or more of such approaches. This Perspective describes the latest developments in this highly important area, and discusses possible future directions.},

The maximization of the determinant of the matrix which appears in pseudo-inverse matrix operations is employed as an objective function of the problem in the present extended approach. The procedure for the maximization of the determinant of the corresponding matrix is proved to be mathematically the same as that of the previously proposed QR method when the number of sensors is less than that of state variables (undersampling). On the other hand, the authors have developed a new algorithm for when the number of sensors is greater than that of state variables (oversampling). Then, a unified formulation of the two algorithms is derived, and the lower bound of the objective function given by this algorithm is shown using the monotone submodularity of the objective function. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on the problem using real datasets is demonstrated by comparing with the results of other algorithms. The numerical results show that the proposed algorithm improves the estimation error by approximately 10\% compared with the conventional methods in the oversampling case, where the estimation error is defined as the ratio of the difference between the reconstructed data and the full observation data to the full observation. For the NOAA-SST sensor problem, which has more than ten thousand sensor candidate points, the proposed algorithm selects the sensor positions in few seconds, which required several hours with the other algorithms in the oversampling case on a 3.40 GHz computer.},

Symmetry arguments provide a way to study these collective behaviors and to simplify their analysis. The Koopman operator is an in nite dimensional linear operator that fully captures a system's nonlinear dynamics through the linear evolution of functions of the state space. Importantly, in contrast with local linearization, it preserves a system's global nonlinear features. We demonstrate how the presence of symmetries a ects the Koopman operator structure and its spectral properties. In fact, we show that symmetry considerations can also simplify nding the Koopman operator approximations using the extended and kernel dynamic mode decomposition methods (EDMD and kernel DMD). Speci cally, representation theory allows us to demonstrate that an isotypic component basis induces a block diagonal structure in operator approximations, revealing hidden organization. Practically, if the symmetries are known, the EDMD and kernel DMD methods can be modi ed to give more e cient computation of the Koopman operator approximation and its eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and eigenmodes. Rounding out the development, we discuss the e ect of measurement noise.},

Given the time series of the lift coefficient at different angles of attack for the OAT15A supercritical profile, the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) technique is used to extract a parameterized, interpretable, and minimal-order description of this dynamics. For all the operating conditions considered, SINDy infers that the dynamics in the lift-coefficient time series can be modeled by a simple parameterized Stuart{\textendash}Landau oscillator, reducing the computation time from hundreds of core hours to seconds. The identified models are then supplemented with equally parameterized low-dimensional dynamic mode decomposition based state observers enabling real-time estimation of the whole flowfield from the predicted lift. The value of this simple model is in the possibility of enriching sparse data sets in the buffet regime for new geometries. Only a few unsteady simulations need to be performed to adjust the coefficients of the identified model and then supplement the data set with new cases. Simplicity, accuracy, and interpretability make the identified model an attractive tool toward the construction of real-time systems to be used during the design, certification, and operational phases of the aircraft life cycle.}

A diversity of regression techniques have been developed for producing the linear model approximation whose solutions are exponentials in time. For spatio-temporal data, DMD provides low-rank and interpretable models in the form of dominant modal structures along with their exponential/oscillatory behavior in time. The majority of DMD algorithms, however, are prone to bias errors from noisy measurements of the dynamics, leading to poor model fits and unstable forecasting capabilities. The optimized DMD algorithm minimizes the model bias with a variable projection optimization, thus leading to stabilized forecasting capabilities. Here, the optimized DMD algorithm is improved by using statistical bagging methods whereby a single set of snapshots is used to produce an ensemble of optimized DMD models. The outputs of these models are averaged to produce a bagging, optimized dynamic mode decomposition (BOP-DMD). BOP-DMD not only improves performance, it also robustifies the model and provides both spatial and temporal uncertainty quantification (UQ). Thus unlike currently available DMD algorithms, BOP-DMD provides a stable and robust model for probabilistic, or Bayesian forecasting with comprehensive UQ metrics.},

The machine-learning method is based on elastic net regularisation which promotes sparsity of the inferred models.

Model-discovery and cross-validation is performed for three cases of separating flows, i.e. periodic hills (Re=10595), converging-diverging channel (Re=12600) and curved backward-facing step (Re=13700). The predictions of the discovered models are significantly improved over the k-{$\omega$} SST also for a true prediction of the flow over periodic hills at Re=37000.

  abstract = {Transport-dominated systems are characterized by the propagation of waves and occur in many applications such as aerodynamics and chemical engineering. To predict the dynamics of such systems, mathematical models should ideally be fast to evaluate and at the same time sufficiently accurate. One possibility for deriving such models is to start with a complex and accurate full-order model (FOM) and use model order reduction (MOR) techniques to obtain a corresponding reduced-order model (ROM). Classical MOR methods are based on approximating the FOM state by a linear combination of ansatz functions or modes, but such approaches are often inadequate in the context of transport-dominated systems. This is one of the reasons why there has been an increasing research effort in the past years to develop MOR techniques which are based on nonlinear approximation ansatzes. As the field of nonlinear MOR is relatively new, there are still many open research questions to be addressed. These include for instance suitable choices for the approximation ansatz as well as appropriate ways for the construction of corresponding ROMs. Furthermore, nonlinear MOR approaches typically lead to ROMs whose evaluation scales with the dimension of the FOM and thus may be too expensive. In fact, similar issues may also occur in the context of linear MOR approaches and, therefore, one uses so-called hyperreduction techniques to obtain fast ROMs. However, classical hyperreduction methods suffer from similar difficulties as classical MOR schemes when being applied to transport-dominated systems. Another challenge is to develop nonlinear MOR techniques which preserve important system properties such as stability. In this thesis, we present a new nonlinear model reduction framework which is based on approximating the state of the FOM by a linear combination of transformed modes. The transformations may be, e.g., achieved by shift operators and are parametrized by so-called paths or shift amounts, which constitute a part of the ROM state. The resulting class of ansatzes is well-suited for obtaining low-dimensional and accurate approximations of transport-dominated systems. For the determination of the modes, we present an optimization approach based on given snapshot data of the FOM state. Furthermore, the construction of the ROM is carried out via a residual minimization approach and we also suggest a new hyperreduction framework to ensure that the ROM can be efficiently evaluated. In addition, we demonstrate how to preserve stability via an energy-based formulation using the framework of so-called port-Hamiltonian systems. Finally, we illustrate the new methodology by means of numerical experiments for some transport-dominated test cases.},

We analyze full-order, optimal controllers for large dynamical systems in the presence of multiple actuators and sensors. The full-order controllers do not require any preliminary model reduction or low-order approximation: this feature allows us to assess the optimal performance of an actuated flow without relying on any estimation process or further hypothesis on the disturbances. We start from the original technique proposed by Bewley et al. (Meccanica 51(12):2997{\textendash}3014, 2016. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11012-016-0547-3), the adjoint of the direct-adjoint (ADA) algorithm. The algorithm is iterative and allows bypassing the solution of the algebraic Riccati equation associated with the optimal control problem, typically infeasible for large systems. In this numerical work, we extend the ADA iteration into a more general framework that includes the design of controllers with multiple, coupled inputs and robust controllers (H{$\infty$} methods). First, we demonstrate our results by showing the analytical equivalence between the full Riccati solutions and the ADA approximations in the multiple inputs case. In the second part of the article, we analyze the performance of the algorithm in terms of convergence of the solution, by comparing it with analogous techniques. We find an excellent scalability with the number of inputs (actuators), making the method a viable way for full-order control design in complex settings. Finally, the applicability of the algorithm to fluid mechanics problems is shown using the linearized Kuramoto{\textendash}Sivashinsky equation and the K{\'a}rm{\'a}n vortex street past a two-dimensional cylinder.},

For a vast range of algorithms, the existence of an oracle to a submodular function is assumed. But how does one check if this oracle indeed represents a submodular function? Consider a function f:\{0,1\}\^n {\textbackslash}rightarrow R. The distance to submodularity is the minimum fraction of values of \$f\$ that need to be modified to make f submodular. If this distance is more than epsilon {$>$} 0, then we say that f is epsilon-far from being submodular. The aim is to have an efficient procedure that, given input f that is epsilon-far from being submodular, certifies that f is not submodular. We analyze a very natural tester for this problem, and prove that it runs in subexponential time. This gives the first non-trivial tester for submodularity. On the other hand, we prove an interesting lower bound (that is, unfortunately, quite far from the upper bound) suggesting that this tester cannot be very efficient in terms of epsilon. This involves non-trivial examples of functions which are far from submodular and yet do not exhibit too many local violations. We also provide some constructions indicating the difficulty in designing a tester for submodularity. We construct a partial function defined on exponentially many points that cannot be extended to a submodular function, but any strict subset of these values can be extended to a submodular function.},

To overcome the deficit of these `rigid' approaches, we propose a new method termed spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD). It is based on classical POD and it can be applied to spatially and temporally resolved data. The new method involves an additional temporal constraint that enables a clear separation of phenomena that occur at multiple frequencies and energies. SPOD allows for a continuous shifting from the energetically optimal POD to the spectrally pure Fourier decomposition by changing a single parameter. In this article, SPOD is motivated from phenomenological considerations of the POD autocorrelation matrix and justified from dynamical systems theory. The new method is further applied to three sets of PIV measurements of flows from very different engineering problems. We consider the flow of a swirl-stabilized combustor, the wake of an airfoil with a Gurney flap and the flow field of the sweeping jet behind a fluidic oscillator. For these examples, the commonly used methods fail to assign the relevant coherent structures to single modes. The SPOD, however, achieves a proper separation of spatially and temporally coherent structures, which are either hidden in stochastic turbulent fluctuations or spread over a wide frequency range. The SPOD requires only one additional parameter, which can be estimated from the basic time scales of the flow. In spite of all these benefits, the algorithmic complexity and computational cost of the SPOD are only marginally greater than those of the snapshot POD.},

The linear terms of the governing equations are reduced by Galerkin projection onto a POD basis of the flow state, while the reduced non- linear convection terms are obtained either by a Galerkin projection onto the same state basis, by a Galerkin projection onto a POD basis representing the nonlinearities or by applying the Discrete Empir- ical Interpolation Method (DEIM) to a POD basis of the nonlinearities. The quality of the reduced order models is assessed as to their stability, accuracy and robustness, and appropriate quantitative measures are introduced and compared. In particular, the properties of the reduced linear terms are compared to those of the full-scale terms, and the structure of the nonlinear quadratic terms is analyzed as to the con- servation of kinetic energy. It is shown that all three reduction techniques provide excellent and similar results for the cases of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and the limit-cycle cylinder flow. For the case of the transient regime of flow past a cylinder, only the pure Galerkin techniques are successful, while the DEIM technique produces reduced-order models that diverge in finite time.},

Our model is trained end-to-end from data and is capable of learning a range of challenging chaotic and turbulent dynamics at low resolution, including trajectories generated by the state-of-the-art Athena++ engine. We show that our simpler, general-purpose architecture outperforms various more specialized, turbulence-specific architectures from the learned turbulence simulation literature.

We also find that while generalization beyond the training distribution is a challenge for learned models, training noise, added loss constraints, and dataset augmentation can help. Broadly, we conclude that our learned simulator outperforms traditional solvers run on coarser grids, and emphasize that simple design choices can offer stability and robust generalization.},

  abstract = {The correlation and extraction of coherent structures from a turbulent flow is a principle objective of data-driven modal decomposition techniques. The Conditional space-time Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (CPOD) offers insight into transient dynamics, revealing the causation of specific flow phenomenon - or events, in a customizable manner. This work exploits the temporal evolution of CPOD modes in a reduced subspace, resulting in new extensions and adaptations that meet or exceed the capabilities of other decomposition methods. Chiefly, it is demonstrated that the subsequent application of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to CPOD modes, provides a flexible tool to investigate targeted flow instabilities, both tonal and convective in nature. By extending the CPOD time-horizon to educe the former type, it is shown that CPOD-DMD can exactly reproduce Spectral POD modes. Regarding the latter, a multi-resolution framework (CPOD-mrDMD) yields a refined "cause and effect" stability analysis, capable of diagnosing the natural forcing mechanisms within the flow, and the resulting unstable modes. In a separate application, CPOD properties are appreciated in the context of reduced order models, with an example of real-time flow prediction of extreme events derived from an active sensor correlated to a CPOD mode. The various CPOD functions and perspectives in this work are demonstrated on: the nonlinear chaotic Lorenz system, 3D intermittent turbulent spots in supersonic boundary layer transition, Schlieren video processing of unstarted inlet buzz, the aeroacoustic feedback forcing of a resonating impinging jet, and prediction of intermittent bluff-body wake structures impinging on a channel wall.},

While the class of linear systems is well studied, theoretical results for nonlinear systems are still rare. In this paper, we present a data-driven controller design method for discrete-time control-affine nonlinear systems. Our approach relies on the Koopman operator, which is a linear but infinite-dimensional operator lifting the nonlinear system to a higher-dimensional space. Particularly, we derive a linear fractional representation of a lifted bilinear system representation based on measured data. Further, we restrict the lifting to finite dimensions, but account for the truncation error using a finite-gain argument. We derive a linear matrix inequality based design procedure to guarantee robust local stability for the resulting bilinear system for all error terms satisfying the finite-gain bound and, thus, also for the underlying nonlinear system. Finally, we apply the developed design method to the nonlinear Van der Pol oscillator.},

A basic problem is sensor and actuator placement: choose a subset from a finite set of possible placements to optimize some real-valued controllability and observability metrics of the network. Surprisingly little is known about the structure of such combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper, we show that several important classes of metrics based on the controllability and observability Gramians have a strong structural property that allows for either efficient global optimization or an approximation guarantee by using a simple greedy heuristic for their maximization. In particular, the mapping from possible placements to several scalar functions of the associated Gramian is either a modular or submodular set function. The results are illustrated on randomly generated systems and on a problem of power-electronic actuator placement in a model of the European power grid.},

In many applications, we have limited access to the information of the whole system, which motivates non-intrusive model reduction. One bottleneck is capturing the dynamics of the solution without knowing the physics inside the ``black-box'' system. DMD is a powerful tool to mimic the dynamics of the system and give a reliable approximation of the solution in the time domain using only the dominant DMD modes. However, DMD cannot reproduce the parametric behavior of the dynamics. Our contribution focuses on extending DMD to parametric DMD by RBF interpolation. Specifically, an RBF network is first trained using snapshot matrices at limited parameter samples. The snapshot matrix at any new parameter sample can be quickly learned from the RBF network. DMD will use the newly generated snapshot matrix at the online stage to predict the time patterns of the dynamics corresponding to the new parameter sample. The proposed framework and algorithm are tested and validated by numerical examples including models with parametrized and time-varying inputs.},

Subspace DMD first computes the orthogonal projection of future snapshots to the space of past snapshots and then estimates the spectra of a linear model, and its output converges to the spectra of the stochastic Koopman operator under standard assumptions.

An ideal set of kernels should: admit a linear parameterization (for tractability); be dense in the set of all kernels (for robustness); be universal (for accuracy). Recently, a framework was proposed for using positive matrices to parameterize a class of positive semi-separable kernels. Although this class can be shown to meet all three criteria, previous algorithms for optimization of such kernels were limited to classification and furthermore relied on computationally complex Semidefinite Programming (SDP) algorithms. In this paper, we pose the problem of learning semiseparable kernels as a minimax optimization problem and propose a SVD-QCQP primal-dual algorithm which dramatically reduces the computational complexity as compared with previous SDP-based approaches. Furthermore, we provide an efficient implementation of this algorithm for both classification and regression -- an implementation which enables us to solve problems with 100 features and up to 30,000 datums. Finally, when applied to benchmark data, the algorithm demonstrates the potential for significant improvement in accuracy over typical (but non-convex) approaches such as Neural Nets and Random Forest with similar or better computation time.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have shown that intermediate magnitude of surface tension has a counterintuitive destabilizing effect on two-phase planar jets. In the present study, the transition process in confined two-dimensional jets of two fluids with varying viscosity ratio is investigated using direct numerical simulations (DNSs). The outer fluid coflow velocity is 17\% of that of the central jet. Neutral curves for the appearance of persistent oscillations are found by recording the norm of the velocity residuals in DNS for over 1000 nondimensional time units or until the signal has reached a constant level in a logarithmic scale, either a converged steady state or a ``statistically steady'' oscillatory state. Oscillatory final states are found for all viscosity ratios ranging from 10-1 to 10. For uniform viscosity (m=1), the first bifurcation is through a surface-tension-driven global instability. On the other hand, for low viscosity of the outer fluid, there is a mode competition between a steady asymmetric Coanda-type attachment mode and the surface-tension-induced mode. At moderate surface tension, the first bifurcation is through the Coanda-type attachment, which eventually triggers time-dependent convective bursts. At high surface tension, the first bifurcation is through the surface-tension-dominated mode. For high viscosity of the outer fluid, persistent oscillations appear due to a strong convective instability, although it is shown that absolute instability may be possible at even higher viscosity ratios. Finally, we show that the jet is still convectively and absolutely unstable far from the inlet when the shear profile is nearly constant. Comparing this situation to a parallel Couette flow (without inflection points), we show that in both flows, a hidden interfacial mode brought out by surface tension becomes temporally and absolutely unstable in an intermediate Weber and Reynolds regime. By an energy analysis of the Couette flow case, we show that surface tension, although dissipative, can induce a velocity field near the interface that extracts energy from the flow through a viscous mechanism. This study highlights the rich dynamics of immiscible planar uniform-density jets, where different self-sustained and convective mechanisms compete and the nature of the instability depends on the exact parameter values.},

Second-order perturbations are required to capture the stabilizing effect of spanwise waviness, which is ignored by standard adjoint-based sensitivity analyses. Here, previous methods are extended so that (i) 2nd-order sensitivity is formulated for base flow changes satisfying linearised Navier-Stokes, and (ii) the resulting method is applicable to a 2D global instability problem. This makes it possible to formulate 2nd-order sensitivity to shape modifications. Using this formulation, we find the optimal shape to suppress the a cylinder wake instability. The optimal shape is then perturbed by random distributions in full 3D stability analysis to confirm that it is a local optimal at the given amplitude and wavelength. Furthermore, it is shown that none of the 10 random wavy shapes alone stabilize the wake flow at Re = 50, while the optimal shape does. At Re = 100, surface waviness of maximum height 1\% of the cylinder diameter is sufficient to stabilize the flow. The optimal surface creates streaks by passively extracting energy from the base flow derivatives and effectively altering the tangential velocity component at the wall, as opposed to spanwise-wavy suction which inputs energy to the normal velocity component at the wall. This paper presents a fully two-dimensional and computationally affordable method to find optimal 2nd-order perturbations of generic flow instability problems and any boundary control (such as boundary forcing, shape modulation or suction).},

More precisely, the proximal policy optimization (PPO) method is used to control the mass flow rate of four synthetic jets symmetrically located on the upper and lower sides of a cylinder immersed in a two-dimensional flow domain. The learning environment supports four flow configurations with Reynolds numbers 100, 200, 300, and 400, respectively. A new smoothing interpolation function is proposed to help the PPO algorithm learn to set continuous actions, which is of great importance to effectively suppress problematic jumps in lift and allow a better convergence for the training process. It is shown that the DRL controller is able to significantly reduce the lift and drag fluctuations and actively reduce the drag by {$\sim$}5.7\%, 21.6\%, 32.7\%, and 38.7\%, at Re = 100, 200, 300, and 400, respectively. More importantly, it can also effectively reduce drag for any previously unseen value of the Reynolds number between 60 and 400. This highlights the generalization ability of deep neural networks and is an important milestone toward the development of practical applications of DRL to active flow control.},

However, the selection of embedding parameters can have a big impact on the resulting analysis. This has led to the creation of a large number of methods to optimise the selection of parameters such as embedding lag. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the fundamentals of embedding theory for readers who are new to the subject. We outline a collection of existing methods for selecting embedding lag in both uniform and non-uniform delay embedding cases. Highlighting the poor dynamical explainability of existing methods of selecting non-uniform lags, we provide an alternative method of selecting embedding lags that includes a mixture of both dynamical and topological arguments. The proposed method, \{{\textbackslash}em Significant Times on Persistent Strands\} (SToPS), uses persistent homology to construct a characteristic time spectrum that quantifies the relative dynamical significance of each time lag. We test our method on periodic, chaotic and fast-slow time series and find that our method performs similar to existing automated non-uniform embedding methods. Additionally, \$n\$-step predictors trained on embeddings constructed with SToPS was found to outperform other embedding methods when predicting fast-slow time series.},

It proceeds by laying the groundwork, introducing the equations and techniques that are at the heart of dynamo theory, before presenting some simple dynamo solutions. The problems currently exercising dynamo theorists are then introduced, along with the attempts to make progress.

  abstract = {Recent work in data-driven modeling has demonstrated that a weak formulation of model equations enhances the noise robustness of a wide range of computational methods. In this paper, we demonstrate the power of the weak form to enhance the LaSDI (Latent Space Dynamics Identification) algorithm, a recently developed data-driven reduced order modeling technique. We introduce a weak form-based version WLaSDI (Weak-form Latent Space Dynamics Identification). WLaSDI first compresses data, then projects onto the test functions and learns the local latent space models. Notably, WLaSDI demonstrates significantly enhanced robustness to noise. With WLaSDI, the local latent space is obtained using weak-form equation learning techniques. Compared to the standard sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) used in LaSDI, the variance reduction of the weak form guarantees a robust and precise latent space recovery, hence allowing for a fast, robust, and accurate simulation. We demonstrate the efficacy of WLaSDI vs. LaSDI on several common benchmark examples including viscid and inviscid Burgers', radial advection, and heat conduction. For instance, in the case of 1D inviscid Burgers' simulations with the addition of up to 100\% Gaussian white noise, the relative error remains consistently below 6\% for WLaSDI, while it can exceed 10,000\% for LaSDI. Similarly, for radial advection simulations, the relative errors stay below 15\% for WLaSDI, in stark contrast to the potential errors of up to 10,000\% with LaSDI. Moreover, speedups of several orders of magnitude can be obtained with WLaSDI. For example applying WLaSDI to 1D Burgers' yields a 140X speedup compared to the corresponding full order model.

  abstract = {Galerkin-based reduced-order models (G-ROMs) have provided efficient and accurate approximations of laminar flows. In order to capture the complex dynamics of the turbulent flows, standard G-ROMs require a relatively large number of reduced basis functions (on the order of hundreds and even thousands). Although the resulting G-ROM is still relatively low-dimensional compared to the full-order model (FOM), its computational cost becomes prohibitive due to the 3rd-order convection tensor contraction. The tensor requires storage of \$N\^3\$ entries with a corresponding work of \$2N\^3\$ operations per timestep, which makes such ROMs impossible to use in realistic applications, such as control of turbulent flows. In this paper, we focus on the scenario where the G-ROM requires large \$N\$ values and propose a novel approach that utilizes the CANDECOMC/PARAFAC decomposition (CPD), a tensor decomposition technique, to accelerate the G-ROM by approximating the 3rd-order convection tensor by a sum of \$R\$ rank-1 tensors. In addition, we show that the tensor is partially skew-symmetric and derive two conditions for the CP decomposition for preserving the skew-symmetry. Moreover, we investigate the G-ROM with the singular value decomposition (SVD). The G-ROM with CP decomposition is investigated in several flow configurations from 2D periodic flow to 3D turbulent flows. Our numerical investigation shows CPD-ROM achieves at least a factor of 10 speedup. Additionally, the skew-symmetry preserving CPD-ROM is more stable and allows the usage of smaller rank \$R\$. Moreover, from the singular value behavior, the advection tensor formed using the \$H\^1\_0\$-POD basis has a low-rank structure, and is preserved even in higher Reynolds numbers. Furthermore, for a given level of accuracy, the CP decomposition is more efficient in size and cost than the SVD.},

  abstract = {The Koopman operator framework provides a perspective that non-linear dynamics can be described through the lens of linear operators acting on function spaces. As the framework naturally yields linear embedding models, there have been extensive efforts to utilize it for control, where linear controller designs in the embedded space can be applied to control possibly nonlinear dynamics. However, it is challenging to successfully deploy this modeling procedure in a wide range of applications. In this work, some of the fundamental limitations of linear embedding models are addressed. We show a necessary condition for a linear embedding model to achieve zero modeling error, highlighting a trade-off relation between the model expressivity and a restriction on the model structure to allow the use of linear systems theories for nonlinear dynamics. To address these limitations, neural network-based modeling is proposed based on linear embedding with oblique projection, which is derived from a weak formulation of projection-based linear operator learning. We train the proposed model using a two-stage learning procedure, wherein the features and operators are initialized with orthogonal projection, followed by the main training process in which test functions characterizing the oblique projection are learned from data. The first stage achieves an optimality ensured by the orthogonal projection and the second stage improves the generalizability to various tasks by optimizing the model with the oblique projection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over other data-driven modeling methods by providing comprehensive numerical evaluations where four tasks are considered targeting three different systems.},

The extraction of approximate Koopman or transfer operator eigenfunctions (and the associated eigenvalues) from an unknown system is nontrivial, particularly if the system has mixed or continuous spectrum. In this paper, we describe a spectrally accurate approach to approximate the Koopman operator on \$L\^2\$ for measure-preserving, continuous-time systems via a ``compactification'' of the resolvent of the generator. This approach employs kernel integral operators to approximate the skew-adjoint Koopman generator by a family of skew-adjoint operators with compact resolvent, whose spectral measures converge in a suitable asymptotic limit, and whose eigenfunctions are approximately periodic. Moreover, we develop a data-driven formulation of our approach, utilizing data sampled on dynamical trajectories and associated dictionaries of kernel eigenfunctions for operator approximation. The data-driven scheme is shown to converge in the limit of large training data under natural assumptions on the dynamical system and observation modality. We explore applications of this technique to dynamical systems on tori with pure point spectra and the Lorenz 63 system as an example with mixing dynamics.},

First, we study the asymptotic properties of the estimated state-space model when only considering zero-mean white noise perturbations on the output sequence. It is shown that, in this case, the MOESPl implementation yields asymptotically unbiased estimates. An important constraint to this result is that the underlying system must have a finite impulse response and subsequently the size of the Hankel matrices, constructed from the input and output data at the beginning of the computations, depends on the number of non-zero Markov parameters. This analysis, however, leads to a second implementation of the elementary MOESP scheme, namely MOESP2. The latter implementation has the same asymptotic properties without the finite impulse response constraint. Secondly, we compare the MOESP2 algorithm with a classical state space model identification scheme. The latter scheme, referred to as the CLASSIC algorithm, is based on the Ho and Kalman realization scheme and estimated Markov parameters. The comparison is done by a sensitivity study, where the effect is studied of the errors on the data on the calculated column space of the shift-invariant subspace. This study demonstrates that the elementary MOESP2 scheme is more robust with respect to the errors considered than the CLASSIC algorithm. In the third part, the model reduction capabilities of the elementary MOESP schemes are analysed when the observations are error-free. We demonstrate in which sense the reduced order model is optimal when acquired with the MOESP schemes. The optimality is expressed by the difference between the 2-norm of the errors on the state (or output) sequence of the reduced-order model and the 2-norm of the matrix containing the rejected singular values being as small as possible. The insights obtained in these three parts are evaluated in a simulation study, and validated in this paper. They lead to the assertion that the MOESP2 implementation allows identification of a compact, low-dimensional, state-space model accurately describing the input -output behaviour of the system to be identified, while making use of `perturbed' input-output data. This can be done efficiently.}

The algorithms have a number of common features. They are classified as one of the subspace model identification schemes, in that a major part of the identification problem consists of calculating specially structured subspaces of spaces defined by the input-output data. This structure is then exploited in the calculation of a realization. Another common feature is their algorithmic organization: an RQ factorization followed by a singular value decomposition and the solution of an overdetermined set (or sets) of equations. The schemes assume that the underlying system has an output-error structure and that a measurable input sequence is available. The latter characteristic indicates that both schemes are versions of the MIMO Output-Error State Space model identification (MOESP) approach. The first algorithm is denoted in particular as the (elementary MOESP scheme). The subspace approximation step requires, in addition to input-output data, knowledge of a restricted set of Markov parameters. The second algorithm, referred to as the (ordinary MOESP scheme), solely relies on input-output data. A compact implementation is presented of both schemes. Although we restrict our presentation here to error-free input-output data, a framework is set up in an identification context. The identification aspects of the presented realization schemes are treated in the forthcoming Parts 2 and 3.}

First, an analysis is made which proves that the asymptotic unbiasedness of the estimated state-space quadruple [AT, BT, CT, D] critically depends on the unbiased calculation of the column space of the extended observability matrix. Second, it is proved that the latter quantity can be calculated asymptotically unbiasedly only when the stochastic additive errors on the output quantity are zero-mean white noise. The extension of the ordinary MOESP scheme with instrumental variables increases the applicability of this scheme. Two types of instrumental variables are proposed: (1) based on past input measurements; and (2) based on reconstructed state quantities. The first type yields asymptotic unbiased estimates when the perturbation on the output quantity is an arbitrary zero-mean stochastic process independent of the error-free input. However, a detailed sensitivity analysis demonstrates that for the finite data-length case the calculations can become very sensitive; this occurs when the particular system at hand has dominant modes close to the unit circle. In the same sensitivity analysis it is shown that far more robust results can be obtained with the second type of instrumental variables when the true state quantities are used. A number of guidelines are derived from the given sensitivity analysis to obtain accurate reconstructed state quantities. Efficient numerical implementations are presented for both extensions of the ordinary MOESP scheme. The obtained insights are verified by means of two realistic simulation studies. The developed extensions and strategy in these studies demonstrate excellent performances in the treatment of both identification problems.}

  abstract = {Rayleigh{\textendash}B{\'e}nard convection (RBC) is a recurrent phenomenon in a number of industrial and geoscience flows and a well-studied system from a fundamental fluid-mechanics viewpoint. In the present work, we conduct numerical simulations to apply deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for controlling two-dimensional RBC using sensor-based feedback control. We show that effective RBC control can be obtained by leveraging invariant multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), which takes advantage of the locality and translational invariance inherent to RBC flows inside wide channels. MARL applied to RBC allows for an increase in the number of control segments without encountering the curse of dimensionality that would result from a naive increase in the DRL action-size dimension. This is made possible by the MARL ability for re-using the knowledge generated in different parts of the RBC domain. MARL is able to discover an advanced control strategy that destabilizes the spontaneous RBC double-cell pattern, changes the topology of RBC by coalescing adjacent convection cells, and actively controls the resulting coalesced cell to bring it to a new stable configuration. This modified flow configuration results in reduced convective heat transfer, which is beneficial in a number of industrial processes. We additionally draw comparisons with a conventional single-agent reinforcement learning (SARL) setup and report that in the same number of episodes, SARL is not able to learn an effective policy to control the cells. Thus, our work both shows the potential of MARL for controlling large RBC systems and demonstrates the possibility for DRL to discover strategies that move the RBC configuration between different topological configurations, yielding desirable heat-transfer characteristics.},

The Chebyshev inertial iteration can be regarded as a valiant of the successive over relaxation or Krasnosel'ski{\textbackslash}v\{{\textbackslash}i\}-Mann iteration utilizing the inverse of roots of a Chebyshev polynomial as iteration dependent inertial factors. One of the most notable features of the proposed method is that it can be applied to nonlinear fixed-point iterations in addition to linear fixed-point iterations. Linearization around the fixed point is the key for the analysis on the local convergence rate of the proposed method. The proposed method appears effective in particular for accelerating the proximal gradient methods such as ISTA. It is also proved that the proposed method can successfully accelerate almost any fixed-point iterations if all the eigenvalues of the Jacobian at the fixed point are real.},

Because of that, we can estimate the ``spectral radius'' and use it in the Chebyshev approach to accelerate the convergence by at least one order of magnitude, when the global step is handled by the direct solver, the Jacobi solver, or even the Gauss-Seidel solver. Our experiment shows that the combination of the Chebyshev approach and the direct solver runs fastest on CPU, while the combination of the Chebyshev approach and the Jacobi solver outperforms any other combination on GPU, as it is highly compatible with parallel computing. Our experiment further shows position-based dynamics can be accelerated by the Chebyshev approach as well, although the effect is less obvious for tetrahedral meshes. The whole approach is simple, fast, effective, GPU-friendly, and has a small memory cost.},

We analyze the performance of the previously proposed estimates for the drift and diffusion function to give bounds on the error for finite data. However, since this algorithm only converges as both the sampling frequency and the length of trajectory go to infinity, obtaining approximations within a certain tolerance may be infeasible. To combat this, we develop estimates with higher orders of accuracy for use in the SINDy framework. For a given sampling frequency, these estimates give more accurate approximations of the drift and diffusion functions, making SINDy a far more feasible system identification method.},

  abstract = {Reducing sensor requirements while keeping optimal control performance is crucial to many industrial control applications to achieve robust, low-cost, and computation-efficient controllers. However, existing feature selection solutions for the typical machine learning domain can hardly be applied in the domain of control with changing dynamics. In this paper, a novel framework, namely the Dual-world embedded Attentive Feature Selection (D-AFS), can efficiently select the most relevant sensors for the system under dynamic control. Rather than the one world used in most Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms, D-AFS has both the real world and its virtual peer with twisted features. By analyzing the DRL's response in two worlds, D-AFS can quantitatively identify respective features' importance towards control. A well-known active flow control problem, cylinder drag reduction, is used for evaluation. Results show that D-AFS successfully finds an optimized five-probes layout with 18.7\% drag reduction than the state-of-the-art solution with 151 probes and 49.2\% reduction than five-probes layout by human experts. We also apply this solution to four OpenAI classical control cases. In all cases, D-AFS achieves the same or better sensor configurations than originally provided solutions. Results highlight, we argued, a new way to achieve efficient and optimal sensor designs for experimental or industrial systems.

The test results show a high sensitivity to rank truncation and a low sensitivity to the time window selection when a reasonable time period is used.

  abstract = {,  The instability mechanism behind a geometrically simple cylindrical roughness element continues to be a challenging topic in fluid mechanics. Considerable progress has been made in understanding the phenomena in recent years, but more research is needed to predict the temporal nature and spatial structure of the dominant instability in a given flow configuration. This is of particular interest, as these instabilities dictate the transition to turbulence and thus are significant for large-scale effects such as skin friction drag. A smoke-flow visualization study with a large variation of parameters, featuring a cylindrical roughness element connected to a linear traverse, has been performed. Results show good agreement with previous investigations and provide further insights into the stability properties, revealing several unexpected effects. For a low roughness aspect ratio {$\mathsl{H}\eta\backslash$}eta, no global instability is detected even at the highest roughness Reynolds number {$\mathsl{R}\mathsl{e}\mathsl{k}\mathsl{k}$}RekkRe\_\{kk\}, whereas a high aspect ratio indicates a delay in the onset of instability. From the acquired visualizations, we constructed the, so far, richest instability diagram of the wake behind an isolated roughness element in the {$\mathsl{R}\mathsl{e}\mathsl{k}\mathsl{k}$}{\textendash}{$\mathsl{H}$}Rekk{\textendash}{$\eta$}Re\_\{kk\}{\textbackslash}unicode\{x2013\}{\textbackslash}eta space, sampled in the same measurement campaign. Furthermore, information regarding the dominant frequency in the wake can be extracted from the visualization images. Our results suggest a new scaling of the frequency as the velocity is increased. Finally, it is shown that the dominant frequency in a certain flow regime can be well predicted using a Strouhal number based on the cylinder diameter and the roughness velocity.},

Then, the sequential threshold least squares is performed to extract the fewest active terms from the overdetermined set of candidate features, thereby estimating structural parameters and initial condition simultaneously and meanwhile, making the identified dynamics parsimonious and interpretable.

Advances in hyper-reduction have enabled the scalable computation of PROMs for general nonlinear dynamical systems. Further, the recent model-form-preserving least squares with variable transformation method has proven capable of generating stable PROMs for extremely stiff multiphysics problems. In this work, we formulate a PROM framework combining these methodologies and demonstrate that robust, accurate, and cost-effective PROMs can be realized for complex nonreacting and reacting compressible flows. Along with an open-source toolchain for hyper-reduction sample mesh generation from extremely large data sets, this represents an end-to-end effort to assess the applicability of PROMs to large-scale, multiphysics problems of engineering interest. We examine practical considerations for implementing hyper-reduction methods and their effect on memory consumption, load balancing, and interprocessor communications. These considerations produce accurate PROMs that are three to four orders of magnitude more computationally efficient than the full-order model in recreating transonic flow over a cavity and reacting flow in a rocket combustor. Guidelines for data preparation, sample mesh construction, and online PROM solution which promote robust simulations are also provided.}

In addition, a systematic approach for effective sensor placement is formulated within the gappy framework using a condition number criterion. This criterion allows for accurate flow reconstruction results and yields sensor configurations that are robust to sensor noise. Two applications are considered. The first aims to reconstruct the unsteady flow field using a small number of surface pressure measurements for a subsonic airfoil undergoing plunging motion. The second considers estimation of POD modal content of a cylinder wake flow for active control purposes.

Downstream tasks from sensing include inferring full state estimates of a system (system identification), control decisions, and forecasting. These tasks are exceptionally challenging to achieve with limited sensors, noisy measurements, and corrupt or missing data. Existing techniques typically use current (static) sensor measurements to perform such tasks and require principled sensor placement or an abundance of randomly placed sensors. In contrast, we propose a SHallow REcurrent Decoder (SHRED) neural network structure which incorporates (i) a recurrent neural network (LSTM) to learn a latent representation of the temporal dynamics of the sensors, and (ii) a shallow decoder that learns a mapping between this latent representation and the high-dimensional state space. By explicitly accounting for the time-history, or trajectory, of the sensor measurements, SHRED enables accurate reconstructions with far fewer sensors, outperforms existing techniques when more measurements are available, and is agnostic towards sensor placement. In addition, a compressed representation of the high-dimensional state is directly obtained from sensor measurements, which provides an on-the-fly compression for modeling physical and engineering systems. Forecasting is also achieved from the sensor time-series data alone, producing an efficient paradigm for predicting temporal evolution with an exceptionally limited number of sensors. In the example cases explored, including turbulent flows, complex spatio-temporal dynamics can be characterized with exceedingly limited sensors that can be randomly placed with minimal loss of performance.},

By contrast, this work explores strategies for nonlinear data-driven estimation of the action of the Koopman operator. General strategies that yield nonlinear models are presented for systems both with and without control. Subsequent projection of the resulting nonlinear equations onto a low-rank basis yields a low order representation for the underlying dynamical system. In both computational and experimental examples considered in this work, linear estimators of the Koopman operator are generally only able to provide short-term predictions for the observable dynamics while comparable nonlinear estimators provide accurate predictions on substantially longer timescales and replicate infinite-time behaviors that linear predictors cannot.},

As more gravitational-wave (GW) events are detected, flexible models such as Gaussian Mixture Models have become more important in fitting the distribution of GW properties due to their expressivity. However, flexible models come with many parameters that lack physical motivation, making interpreting the implication of these models challenging. In this work, we demonstrate symbolic regression can complement flexible models by distilling the posterior predictive distribution of such flexible models into interpretable analytic expressions. We recover common GW population models such as a power-law-plus-Gaussian, and find a new empirical population model which combines accuracy and simplicity. This demonstrates a strategy to automatically discover interpretable population models in the ever-growing GW catalog, which can potentially be applied to other astrophysical phenomena.},

We present a formulation and analysis of the modes and spectrum from MZMD and compare it to DMD when applied to a complex flow: a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data-set of laminar-turbulent boundary-layer transition flow over a flared cone at Mach 6. We show that the addition of memory terms by MZMD improves the resolution of spatio-temporal structures within the transitional/turbulent regime, which contains features that arise due to nonlinear mechanisms, such as the generation of the so-called "hot" streaks on the surface of the flared cone. As a result, compared to DMD, MZMD improves future state prediction accuracy, while requiring nearly the same computational cost.},

The jet is manipulated with one unsteady minijet blowing in wall-normal direction close to the nozzle exit. The flow is monitored with two hotwire sensors. The first sensor is positioned on the centerline 5 jet diameters downstream of the nozzle exit, i.e. the end of the potential core, while the second is located 3 jet diameters downstream and displaced towards the shear-layer. The mixing performance is monitored with mean velocity at the first sensor. A reduction of this velocity correlates with increased entrainment near the potential core. MLC is employed to optimize sensor feedback, a general open-loop broadband frequency actuation and combinations of both. MLC has identified the optimal periodic forcing with small duty cycle as the best control policy employing only 400 actuation measurements, each lasting for 5 seconds. This learning rate is comparable if not faster than typical optimization of periodic forcing with two free parameters (frequency and duty cycle). In addition, MLC results indicate that neither new frequencies nor sensor feedback improves mixing further{\^a}contrary to many of other turbulence control experiments. The optimality of pure periodic actuation may be attributed to the simple jet flapping mechanism in the minijet plane. The performance of sensor feedback is shown to face a challenge for small duty cycles. The jet mixing results demonstrate the untapped potential of MLC in quickly learning optimal general control policies, even deciding between open- and closed-loop control.},

  abstract = {Inference, prediction, and control of complex dynamical systems from time series is important in many areas, including financial markets, power grid management, climate and weather modeling, or molecular dynamics. The analysis of such highly nonlinear dynamical systems is facilitated by the fact that we can often find a (generally nonlinear) transformation of the system coordinates to features in which the dynamics can be excellently approximated by a linear Markovian model. Moreover, the large number of system variables often change collectively on large time- and length-scales, facilitating a low-dimensional analysis in feature space. In this paper, we introduce a variational approach for Markov processes (VAMP) that allows us to find optimal feature mappings and optimal Markovian models of the dynamics from given time series data. The key insight is that the best linear model can be obtained from the top singular components of the Koopman operator. This leads to the definition of a family of score functions called VAMP-r which can be calculated from data, and can be employed to optimize a Markovian model. In addition, based on the relationship between the variational scores and approximation errors of Koopman operators, we propose a new VAMP-E score, which can be applied to cross-validation for hyper-parameter optimization and model selection in VAMP. VAMP is valid for both reversible and nonreversible processes and for stationary and nonstationary processes or realizations.},

We consider the case where data is drawn from sampling a probability distribution that has support on or near a submanifold of Euclidean space. In this paper, we propose a novel subspace learning algorithm called Neighborhood Preserving Embedding (NPE). Different from Principal Component Analysis (PCA) which aims at preserving the global Euclidean structure, NPE aims at preserving the local neighborhood structure on the data manifold. Therefore, NPE is less sensitive to outliers than PCA. Also, comparing to the recently proposed manifold learning algorithms such as Isomap and Locally Linear Embedding, NPE is defined everywhere, rather than only on the training data points. Furthermore, NPE may be conducted in the original space or in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space into which data points are mapped. This gives rise to kernel NPE. Several experiments on face database demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.},

Classical dimensional analysis and similitude theory fail to identify a set of unique dimensionless numbers for a highly multi-variable system with incomplete governing equations. This paper introduces a mechanistic data-driven approach that embeds the principle of dimensional invariance into a two-level machine learning scheme to automatically discover dominant dimensionless numbers and governing laws (including scaling laws and differential equations) from scarce measurement data. The proposed methodology, called dimensionless learning, is a physics-based dimension reduction technique. It can reduce high-dimensional parameter spaces to descriptions involving only a few physically interpretable dimensionless parameters, greatly simplifying complex process design and system optimization. We demonstrate the algorithm by solving several challenging engineering problems with noisy experimental measurements (not synthetic data) collected from the literature. Examples include turbulent Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard convection, vapor depression dynamics in laser melting of metals, and porosity formation in 3D printing. Lastly, we show that the proposed approach can identify dimensionally homogeneous differential equations with dimensionless number(s) by leveraging sparsity-promoting techniques.},

At each step of the rational Krylov subspace methods, a shifted linear system of equations needs to be solved to enlarge the subspace. For large-scale problems, such a linear system is usually solved approximately by an iterative method. The main question is how to relax the accuracy of these linear solves without negatively affecting the convergence of the approximation of f (A)b. Our insight into this issue is obtained by exploring the residual bounds for the rational Krylov subspace approximations of f (A)b, based on the decaying behavior of the entries in the first column of certain matrices of A restricted to the rational Krylov subspaces. The decay bounds for these entries for both analytic functions and Markov functions can be efficiently and accurately evaluated by appropriate quadrature rules. A heuristic based on these bounds is proposed to relax the tolerances of the linear solves arising in each step of the rational Krylov subspace methods. As the algorithm progresses toward convergence, the linear solves can be performed with increasingly lower accuracy and computational cost. Numerical experiments for large nonsymmetric matrices show the effectiveness of the tolerance relaxation strategy for the inexact linear solves of rational Krylov subspace methods.},

The former is commonly used to model the disturbance developing in flat-plate boundary layer flows. These flow systems are convectively unstable, being able to amplify the upstream disturbance, and are thus difficult to control. The control action is implemented through a volumetric force at a fixed position, and the control performance is evaluated by the reduction of perturbation amplitude downstream. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the DRL-based control in the KS system subjected to a random upstream noise. The amplitude of perturbation monitored downstream is reduced significantly, and the learnt policy is shown to be robust to both measurement and external noise. One of our focuses is to place sensors optimally in the DRL control using the gradient-free particle swarm optimisation algorithm. After the optimisation process for different numbers of sensors, a specific eight-sensor placement is found to yield the best control performance. The optimised sensor placement in the KS equation is applied directly to control two-dimensional Blasius boundary layer flows, and can efficiently reduce the downstream perturbation energy. Via flow analyses, the control mechanism found by DRL is the opposition control. Besides, it is found that when the flow instability information is embedded in the reward function of DRL to penalise the instability, the control performance can be further improved in this convectively unstable flow.},

In the PCDRL model, each agent corresponds to a point in the flow field and learns an optimal strategy for choosing pre-defined actions. The proposed model is efficient considering the visualisation of the action map and the interpretation of the model operation. The performance of the model is tested by using direct numerical simulation-based synthetic noisy data and experimental data obtained by particle image velocimetry. Qualitative and quantitative results show that the model can reconstruct the flow fields and reproduce the statistics and the spectral content with commendable accuracy. Furthermore, the dominant coherent structures of the flow fields can be recovered by the flow fields obtained from the model when they are analysed using proper orthogonal decomposition and dynamic mode decomposition.

The present work introduces an autoencoder framework that combines implicit regularization with internal linear layers and \$L\_2\$ regularization (weight decay) to automatically estimate the underlying dimensionality of a data set, produce an orthogonal manifold coordinate system, and provide the mapping functions between the ambient space and manifold space, allowing for out-of-sample projections. We validate our framework's ability to estimate the manifold dimension for a series of datasets from dynamical systems of varying complexities and compare to other state-of-the-art estimators. We analyze the training dynamics of the network to glean insight into the mechanism of low-rank learning and find that collectively each of the implicit regularizing layers compound the low-rank representation and even self-correct during training. Analysis of gradient descent dynamics for this architecture in the linear case reveals the role of the internal linear layers in leading to faster decay of a "collective weight variable" incorporating all layers, and the role of weight decay in breaking degeneracies and thus driving convergence along directions in which no decay would occur in its absence. We show that this framework can be naturally extended for applications of state-space modeling and forecasting by generating a data-driven dynamic model of a spatiotemporally chaotic partial differential equation using only the manifold coordinates. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework is robust to hyperparameter choices.},

  abstract = {Koopman operator describes evolution of observables in the phase space, which could be used to extract characteristic dynamical features of a nonlinear system. Here, we show that it is possible to carry out interesting symbolic partitions based on properly constructed eigenfunctions of the operator for chaotic maps. The partition boundaries are the extrema of these eigenfunctions, the accuracy of which is improved by including more basis functions in the numerical computation. The validity of this scheme is demonstrated in well-known 1-d and 2-d maps. It seems no obstacle to extend the computation to nonlinear systems of high dimensions, which provides a possible way of dissecting complex dynamics.},

  abstract = {Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a popular technique for modal decomposition, flow analysis, and reduced-order modeling. In situations where a system is time varying, one would like to update the system's description online as time evolves. This work provides an efficient method for computing DMD in real time, updating the approximation of a system's dynamics as new data becomes available. The algorithm does not require storage of past data, and computes the exact DMD matrix using rank-1 updates. A weighting factor that places less weight on older data can be incorporated in a straightforward manner, making the method particularly well suited to time-varying systems. A variant of the method may also be applied to online computation of ``windowed DMD'', in which only the most recent data are used. The efficiency of the method is compared against several existing DMD algorithms: for problems in which the state dimension is less than about 200, the proposed algorithm is the most efficient for realtime computation, and it can be orders of magnitude more efficient than the standard DMD algorithm. The method is demonstrated on several examples, including a time-varying linear system and a more complex example using data from a wind tunnel experiment. In particular, we show that the method is effective at capturing the dynamics of surface pressure measurements in the flow over a flat plate with an unsteady separation bubble.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of selecting an optimal set of sensors to estimate the states of linear dynamical systems. Specifically, the goal is to choose (at design-time) a subset of sensors (satisfying certain budget constraints) from a given set in order to minimize the trace of the steady state a priori or a posteriori error covariance produced by a Kalman filter. We show that the a priori and a posteriori error covariance-based sensor selection problems are both NP-hard, even under the additional assumption that the system is stable. We then provide bounds on the worst-case performance of sensor selection algorithms based on the system dynamics, and show that greedy algorithms are optimal for a certain class of systems. However, as a negative result, we show that certain typical objective functions are not submodular or supermodular in general. While this makes it difficult to evaluate the performance of greedy algorithms for sensor selection (outside of certain special cases), we show via simulations that these greedy algorithms perform well in practice.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a data-driven nonparametric approach is presented for forecasting the probability density evolution of stochastic dynamical systems. The method is based on stochastic Koopman operator and extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD). To approximate the finite-dimensional eigendecomposition of the stochastic Koopman operator, EDMD is applied to the training data set sampled from the stationary distribution of the underlying stochastic dynamical system. The family of the Koopman operators form a semigroup, which is generated by the infinitesimal generator of the stochastic dynamical system. A significant connection between the generator and Fokker-Planck operator provides a way to construct an orthonormal basis of a weighted Hilbert space. A spectral decomposition of the probability density function is accomplished in this weighted space. This approach is a data-driven method and used to predict the probability density evolution and real-time moment estimation. In the limit of the large number of snapshots and observables, the data-driven probability density approximation converges to the Galerkin projection of the semigroup solution of Fokker-Planck equation on a basis adapted to an invariant measure. The proposed method shares the similar idea to diffusion forecast, but renders more accurate probability density than the diffusion forecast does. A few numerical examples are presented to illustrate the performance of the data-driven probability density forecast.},

  abstract = {Reconstruction of unsteady vortical flow fields from limited sensor measurements is challenging. We develop machine learning methods to reconstruct flow features from sparse sensor measurements during transient vortex-airfoil wake interaction using only a limited amount of training data. The present machine learning models accurately reconstruct the aerodynamic force coefficients, pressure distributions over airfoil surface, and two-dimensional vorticity field for a variety of untrained cases. Multi-layer perceptron is used for estimating aerodynamic forces and pressure profiles over the surface, establishing a nonlinear model between the pressure sensor measurements and the output variables. A combination of multi-layer perceptron with convolutional neural network is utilized to reconstruct the vortical wake. Furthermore, the use of transfer learning and long short-term memory algorithm combined in the training models greatly improves the reconstruction of transient wakes by embedding the dynamics. The present machine-learning methods are able to estimate the transient flow features while exhibiting robustness against noisy sensor measurements. Finally, appropriate sensor locations over different time periods are assessed for accurately estimating the wakes. The present study offers insights into the dynamics of vortex-airfoil interaction and the development of data-driven flow estimation.},

The method builds on a Riemmannian optimization procedure on the Grassmann manifold of low-dimensional subspaces, namely the Grassmannian Rank-One Update Subspace Estimation (GROUSE). We establish for GROUSE a closed-form expression for the residual function along the geodesic descent direction. Specific applications of subspace adaptation are discussed in the context of image processing and model reduction of nonlinear partial differential equation systems.},
